OA26: Second Amendment Masterclass, Part 2

A property owner agrees to sell one of his real estate parcels to a neighbor. He wrote up an agreement for sale with a sale price of $200,000 and signed the document. The neighbor took it and returned with a bank check for the $200,000 dollars demanding that the deed be tendered. The property owner then decided that the terms were not reasonable, and he returned the money and refused to tender the deed as required by the agreement.

The neighbor sued for specific performance of the transaction. The property owner defended on the basis that the neighbor did not accept the agreement's terms and did not sign the document. Is the court likely to rule in favor of the neighbor?

A) No, because the neighbor did not expressly state that he accepted the agreement.
B) No, because the neighbor had to put his signature on the document to make it a binding contract.
C) Yes, Because the neighbor manifested his assent by his conduct of tendering the full sale price, at which point a contract existed.
D) Yes, Because the property owner created a binding contract when he prepared an agreement containing the agreed terms.

OA27: Abortion and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, Part 1

An inexperienced bicycle rider took her new bike for a test run. I already love this question. At an intersection, she could not stop for a red light and went into the intersection where she slipped off the bike. While attempting to remount it, a car coming into the intersection with a green light ran her over, causing severe injuries. The car driver was distracted by his cell phone and received a careless driving ticket from the police. The woman filed a claim for damages, asserting that the car driver was negligent per se. She claimed that a finding of negligence per se prevented the driver from asserting comparative negligence under a state statute. Will the trial court likely grant the woman's motion to preclude the man's attempted comparative negligence defense?

A. Yes, because the driver had the last clear chance to avoid the accident, which abrogates the comparative negligence law.
B. Yes, because negligence per se is a final judgment of total negligence against the driver and it cannot be modified or rebutted.
C. No, because the common law doctrine of negligence per se does not abrogate the defendant's right to apportion fault under the comparative negligence statute.
D. No, because she entered the intersection knowing it was a red light, thereby putting herself voluntarily and knowingly in danger and she assumed the risk.

Question #003.
OA28: Abortion and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, Part 2

A man sued a manufacturer of video and home theater equipment after his home theater started a raging fire, destroying the equipment and part of his home. He sued the manufacturer in federal court. At trial, the defendants filed a motion to preclude the report and testimony of the plaintiff's expert witness under Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 702. The defendants claim bias, lack of scientific support, failure to conduct testing, divergence of opinion among experts, and that the expert was trained for large commercial fires. The expert had investigated over 500 fires, wrote a book that was used in courses nationwide, and taught a course in forensic fire investigations at a university. Her report ruled out all other possible causes. The court did a gatekeeping review, as required by Rule 702, and ruled that the expert was highly qualified and that she used accepted scientific methodologies in arriving at her opinion. The defendants appealed the ruling.

Is the appellate court likely to go against the trial court ruling under these facts?

A, yes, because the charge of bias against an expert witness requires a "trial within a trial", and that was not done.
B, yes. Because whenever the expert does not back up her conclusion with experimental testing, an expert's opinion will be insufficiently reliable to be allowed.
C, no, the court did the required gatekeeping inquiry and found that the witness was not only qualified and competent, but also used accepted methodologies.
D, no, the court has absolute discretion in deciding the competency of the expert for purposes of giving expert trial testimony and evidence.

Question #004.
OA30: Little Baby Jesus in a Manger

A homeowner buys a new leaf blower and is so impressed with its power that he gets carried away and blows large amounts of his work onto his next door neighbor's yard. In addition to leaves, he also blew large amounts of pest-infested plant debris onto the neighbor's property. The material has accumulated into large, unsightly piles and caused damage to the neighbor's healthy plants. He has to pay workers to haul the material away and incurs expenses to replace the infected perennials. The neighbor sues for the tort of trespass. The homeowner files a motion to dismiss because the neighbor cannot prove that the homeowner acted with intent to trespass or to do harm.

Will the court grant my motion to dismiss?

A. No, because the infected debris constituted an abnormally dangerous condition and the homeowner could be held strictly liable for the trespass.
B. No, because trespass is based on an intentional act of entering the land or sending something onto the land and the actor does not have to intend harm to be liable for the tort.
C. Yes, because the homeowner had no practical way of controlling where the material went and he acted without malice or ill will.
D. Yes, because the homeowner expected the wind to carry the debris away and did not think that it would accumulate on the neighbor's property.

Question #005.
OA32: Phil Iveyâ€™s Gambling Winnings (with guest Chris Kristofco)

A creditor instituted a garnishment action against a woman who owed the creditor a back due debt. This was the first action taken, and the creditor did not have a judgment. It served the notice of garnishment on the garnishee, the woman's employer. The employer honored the notice by holding all of the woman's earnings in escrow, pending the creditor's lawsuit, and the entrance of a final judgment against the woman. The state where the defendant lived and worked had a provision for pre-judgment garnishment as long as the money was held and not distributed until the judgment was entered. The money would be paid to the woman if a judgment was not entered within the next 120 days. The woman sued the employer and the creditor, demanding the release of her earnings.

Will the court order the garnishee to release the funds to the woman?

A. No, because the state procedure for protecting the woman's money until a judgment is entered is a fair one that comports with procedural due process.
B. No, because the state has an interest in protecting the rights of creditors to collect debts through the garnishment procedure.
C. Yes, because the only party that has garnishment rights in the United States is the Internal Revenue Service.
D. yes, because the interim freezing of wages without a chance to be heard violates procedural due process.

Question #006.
OA34: The "Fallout" Over Copyright

Two people who have been cohabiting decide to get married. The man asks the woman to agree that all of his property that he now owns will remain in his name if they ever get divorced. She agrees to that, but demands a written document. However, they get married without having signed anything. Three months later, the husband leaves the wife for another woman. He sends her the notice to vacate the home due to their prenuptial agreement. When she doesn't move, the husband sues, asking for the enforcement of the oral prenuptial contract.

Will the court likely enforce the husband's claim?

A. Yes, because the consideration for the contract was the marriage and the consummation of the marriage made the contract complete and enforceable.
B. Yes, because prenuptial agreements are given the benefit of the doubt when it comes to enforcement decisions.
C. No, because a contract in consideration of marriage must be in writing and the prenuptial was therefore not legal so long as it remained oral.
D. No, because the husband did not live up to the promise to put the agreement in writing and therefore he was guilty of fraud.

Question #007.
OA36: The Emoluments Clause (w/Seth Barrett Tillman) Part 2

A painter working for a construction company was working with a group of construction co-workers on a house when a section of the house fell down on the owner. The painter declared, quote, I knew they should have reinforced the standing wall better than that. It's all their fault. And it turned out he was referring to co-workers employed by the same construction company. The owner filed suit for damages against the construction business. He tried to put the statement from the painter into evidence, but the defendant objected. Will the court sustain the company's objection, that is, as the defendant, to the admission of the painter's statements? Okay, so this is a question about hearsay.

Will the court sustain the defendant building construction company their objection to the admissibility of the painter's statements?

A. Yes, because the painter is not qualified to make such statements regarding non-painting duties.
B. Yes, because the painter is not a participant as a negligent party in the catastrophic mistake that occurred.
C. No, because the painter works for the same company as the negligent workers and he made his statements within the scope and course of his employment.
D. No, because the painter may testify as a subcontractor to what he observed while on the location.

Question #008.
OA38: FLSA and Exempt Employees, Part 2

Some homeless people started residing on a strip of land located under a bridge. The land was owned by a nearby chemical manufacturer. The squatters did not ask permission and the company did not feel it was an urgent problem. The squatters used a small lake on the property for bathing and drinking water. Within a few days, two squatters died from what was later revealed to be highly polluted water coming from the company's waste discharges. The company knew that it had a waste discharge problem. estates of the two decedents sued the company.

Will they likely prevail on their tort claim despite the company's defense that the decedents were trespassers?

A. Yes, because even though they trespassed, the owner had a duty to warn because it knew that they were in danger.
B. Yes, because the owner was strictly liable for any injuries caused by the hazardous condition of the water in the lake.
C. No, because the owner owes no duty to trespassers except if it acts with willful or wanton disregard.
D. No, because an owner of land never has to worry about protecting the safety of trespassers.

Question #009.
OA40: Who is Neil Gorsuch, and How Scared Should You Be?

Two cousins took title to real estate as joint tenants. The first cousin put up his interest in the joint tenancy as security for a $20,000 loan and signed a judgment note. It was later entered as a judgment against that cousin's interest in the real estate. The first cousin then died a year later. The second cousin defended on the basis that any lien on the first cousin's interest in the property was extinguished on the first cousin's death.

Will the court enforce the lien of the mortgagee against the sale of the property by the second cousin?

A. Yes, because the second cousin's assent to the judgment lien was presumed by law.
B. Yes, because the joint tenancy was broken when the first cousin put the judgment lien on the property.
C. No, because the judgment lien was never valid. A joint tenant cannot file a judgment note on just that joint tenant's interest. Or
D. No, because when the first cousin died, the second cousin became the sole owner due to the right of survivorship, as per the joint tenancy, which was still fully intact.

Question #010.
OA42: Denny Hastert and the Limits of Contract Law

A college student files a criminal case against his former roommate, claiming that the former roommate snuck in and removed his state-of-the-art home theater equipment from his house. The college student took the approved prosecution papers and filed them with a magistrate court. An ongoing police investigation determined, however, that the college student was a vengeful person, not averse to creating stories, and that he and the former roommate had been arguing over a number of issues. They also determined that he never had any quality sound or video. The police decide to drop the prosecution. The case is dismissed at the preliminary hearing.

When the former roommate filed a civil case against the complainant for malicious prosecution, will the evidence of defendant's reputation for dishonesty be admissible?

A. Yes, because dishonesty at any time in the past is always relevant to a malicious prosecution complaint.
B. Yes, because even though character evidence is too collateral to be admitted for circumstantial evidence, it is admissible if it is directly at issue in the case.
C. Yes, because reputation evidence, just like most character evidence, is virtually always admissible.
D. Yes, because while most character evidence is not admissible, some is, and reputation evidence is always admissible.

Question #011.
OA44: All About Arbitration

A patient who had surgery to repair a rupture in her spleen followed up with a full body MRI due to the excruciating pain that had developed. During the MRI, the technician saw at least two identifiable sponges that had been left in her body. The patient sued the hospital and the doctor for medical malpractice. She did not produce the printouts of the MRI. Instead, she attempted to testify as to what she observed on the MRI scan. The defense objected and insisted that she must produce the actual MRI printouts.

What is the most likely ruling of the trial judge with respect to the objection?

A. She does not have to produce the MRI scan because a layperson can testify to things of common knowledge, such as what a sponge looks like.
B. She does have to produce the MRI scan because a layperson cannot testify as to personal observations.
C. She does not have to produce the MRI scan because she can testify as to the content of her own medical records.
D. She must produce the MRI records because it represents the best evidence under the best evidence rule.

Question #012.
OA46: What Could Donald Trumpâ€™s Tax Returns Tell Us? (With Guest Tony Di Fatta) - Part 2

A witness sees a murder in the park and is called to testify in the criminal case. The defense counsel knows that she was cited several times for illegally feeding the pigeons. Defense counsel tried to ask "You have a long time habit of feeding the pigeons, don't you? You have, in fact, been ticketed several times for feeding pigeons, haven't you? And yet you persisted in doing it."

Will the trial court likely allow the witness to be questioned on these matters?

A. No, because the question has no probative value regarding the credibility of the witness or the guilt of the defendant.
B. No, because a witness can never be asked about personal prior bad acts.
C. Yes, because the statement indicates that the witness's attention was always focused on feeding the pigeons.
D. Yes, because feeding pigeons in the park and persisting in it after being ticketed may show an antisocial trait of the witness.

Question #013.
OA48: Three Cases You Care About - Planned Parenthood, Gay Florists, and Litigious Quacks

A man is sitting on a beach chair peacefully and in a relaxed meditative state when a truck racing on the sand ran down a sunbathing elderly person. The man said out loud "Oh god, look what that truck driver did". The man driving that truck was racing and going about 100 miles an hour. Someone called 911. A woman who was sitting on the beach nearby but facing the other way heard the man's outcry.

When the case comes to trial, will the court allow both the man and the woman to testify about the man's utterances?

A. Yes, because both the woman and the man can testify because it is an excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule that goes to the material issue of the case.
B. Yes, because this is not hearsay and it is not being entered for the truth of the statement by either witness so that they can both testify.
C. No, neither of them can testify because the man was impaired due to being too relaxed from his meditation. My laughing is not an indication that this is an incorrect answer, but that is funny. And the woman cannot repeat the utterances of an impaired witness. Pretty clever.
D. No, neither can testify because the utterances do not fit any of the exceptions to the hearsay rule.

Question #014.
OA50: Obamaâ€™s Fiduciary Rule (With Guest Ben Offit)

A man with a long history of criminal violence who is a psychopathic personality often enjoys the act of mercilessly brutalizing innocent elderly people by physical torture that is heinous and shocking. He decides to torture the victim's father for no good reason. After the beating, the father is hospitalized and in intensive care. The victim was not present, but read about it in the newspaper and heard about it from the authorities. The victim suffered extreme emotional distress and required medical treatment.

Can the victim bring a successful action against the perpetrator for the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress?

A. No, because the victim was not present at the time that the outrageous behavior occurred.
B. Yes, because the activity was outrageous and shocking.
C. No, because the perpetrator did not know that the father had immediate family members.
D, Yes, because in torture cases, there is strict liability imposed on the perpetrator.

Question #015.
OA52: Thomas Knows Words! Thomas Has The Best Words!

An elderly woman was mugged and robbed on a public street. At the time of the offense, the victim saw only her assailant's eyes. A hooded sweatshirt and bandanna concealed the rest of his face. A few days later, while the victim waited to be interviewed, she observed the defendant being escorted through the courthouse in jail clothing and restrained by handcuffs and leg irons. She identified him as the perpetrator shortly thereafter.

Will the court allow that identification into evidence?

A. No, because it is not reliable enough and there was too much suggestion to make a reasonably accurate identification.
B. No, because prior statements of identification are considered hearsay and never allowed it to evidence.
C. Yes, if the witness perceived the perpetrator by seeing his eyes and made the identification on that basis, it was reliable enough to be admitted.
D. Yes, because the witness's recognition of someone is all that is needed. The reliability or credibility of it is subject to cross-examination.

Question #016.
OA54: Gerrymandering

A business person sent his employee and administrative assistant to represent him at a conference where business deals are often negotiated. The principal gave the assistant all of the materials to set up a table with the principal's cards, brochures, promotional materials, price lists, and even some order forms with his logo on them. In addition, the assistant represented the third parties that she was there officially representing the principal and that she was authorized to execute contracts on his behalf. The assistant negotiated a deal for the business person with a third party which the business person refused to honor because he did not like the terms that were negotiated

Will the third party likely prevail in enforcing the contract against the principal?

A, Yes, because the furnishing of the indication of authority to act To the employee was sufficient proof to bind the principal.
B. Yes, because the principal is bound to the employee's actions whenever he sends an employee to attend a convention on his behalf.
C. No, because people dealing with an assistant at a convention have a duty to determine whether that person is in fact an authorized agent.
D, No, because the technological revolution makes it easy these days for a potential customer to first confirm the existence of actual authority.

Question #017.
OA56: Jury Secrecy and Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado

A man went shopping to buy a used car. He found one on a used car lot that was offered, quote, as is. He looked at it thoroughly. The tag on the window indicated a special 30-point inspection was done on the car. The man put a $1,000 down payment down on the car. He took the car to an independent mechanic who told him that the car had been in an accident, sustained severe damage, including a cracked engine block. The mechanic believed that the dealer had to know about such extensive damage. The man tried to return the car and get his down payment back, but the dealer refused. Stuck with a lemon, the man sued the company under a common law fraud theory. The company counterclaimed for the balance of the purchase price.

Will the man likely prevail in the litigation?

A. Yes, the man will likely prevail in the litigation because the dealer withheld material information intentionally and knowingly misrepresenting the condition of the car.
B. Yes, because the dealer has a duty to give every reason why an as-is car may go bad and list those reasons on the window.
C. No, because the dealer cannot be held responsible for possible damage that the used car may have developed after years of use.
D. No, because the dealer is absolutely protected when he sells a used car in as-is condition.

Question #018.
OA58: What Football Can Teach Us About Jury Nullification, Antitrust, and Donald Trump - Part 2

Men over 65 must wear only brown or gray attire, while those under 65 must wear button-down dress shirts with neckties, except for when they are exercising or working physically. The Act has other restrictions and specifications for dress and grooming mandates for men and women. A class action is filed to challenge the constitutionality of the Act.

Which argument listed below more closely reflects the constitutional argument that is most likely to succeed in court?

A. The law is unconstitutional because it violates the Commerce Clause.
B. The law is unconstitutional because it denies all citizens the equal protection of the law.
C. The law is unconstitutional because it violates procedural due process.
D. The law is unconstitutional because it is not rationally related to a legitimate government interest.

Question #019.
OA60: Sex and Sexual Orientation

Two companies, a construction company and a landscaping firm, got into a contract dispute over the nature of landscaping services that had to be provided to the construction company. The landscaping firm was incorporated in New York and did all of its business in that state. The construction company was an LLC that had been filed in New York with its members being domiciled in Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Virginia. The landscaping firm filed a breach of contract claim in federal court in New York claiming diversity jurisdiction within a mountain dispute that was in excess of $100,000. The construction firm filed a motion to dismiss claiming that the landscaper plaintiff did not have diversity jurisdiction.

Will the court likely grant the motion to dismiss?

A. Yes, there is clearly no diversity in that the construction company LLC and the landscaper corporation were both registered and filed in New York, making them citizens of the same state.
B. Yes, because diversity must be between natural citizens and business entities are not entitled to diversity, but must find some other reason for federal jurisdiction.
C. No, the motion to dismiss is premature and must wait until all discovery is completed before it will be considered.
D. No, the plaintiff is a citizen of New York and the three members of the LLC are each from different states, which gives complete diversity of citizenship.

Question #020.
OA62: The Supreme Courtâ€™s Hall of Shame

A regulation prevents persons with a drug arrest and conviction and or those undergoing current treatment for drug abuse from working in certain state-run facilities for the safety of the general public. One employee of the Department of the Treasury brought an action claiming a denial of equal protection and due process by taking away his right to a job. It is claimed that the prohibition is necessary to protect the public from potential problems that could arise.

Which test of constitutional validity would likely be applied to this regulation?

A. Strict scrutiny since drug users are a special class of persons often discriminated against by the public.
B. Intermediate scrutiny, because like gender, this can be a sensitive area where discrimination is common.
C. The rational basis test, because discrimination is generally favored with drug users or even those getting treatment.
D. The rational basis test, because the regulation need only be related to a legitimate state interest to be valid.

Question #021.
OA64: How "Net Neutrality" Became "Selling the Internet" - A Choose-Your-Own Adventure, Part 1

The state constitution in one state guaranteed the right to marry to same-sex and opposite-sex couples alike. A political group got a proposition on the ballot and a majority of the people voted to eliminate the right of same-sex couples to marry. The proposition did not affect any of the other rights that same-sex couples may have possessed from existing state law. Persons affected sued the state government for unconstitutionally taking away the rights that they had and doing it for no legitimate purpose in violation of the due process clause of the 14th Amendment.

Will the court grant the request of the lawsuit and declare the proposition void and reinstate the right of same-sex couples to marry?

A. Yes, under the Due Process Clause, no compelling state interest justifies denying same-sex couples the fundamental right to marry.
B. Yes, because under the Fourth Amendment, it would be an illegal interference against the right of privacy guaranteed to everyone.
C. No, because the people voted to take a provision out of the existing Constitution, and when that is done by public vote, it cannot be altered.
D. No, because the ballot proposition was properly placed on the ballot and all statutory procedures were followed, thus precluding the courts from taking adverse action.

Question #022.
OA66: Sanctuary Cities

At a yard sale, a seller puts out an old etching that he inherited from his aunt. He labels it with a price tag of $10. A buyer comes by, fully aware that it is the work of a famous Italian Renaissance artist, and quietly offers the $10 for an etching that he knows to be worth at least $100,000. When the seller finds out that he made an awful mistake and that the buyer knew it was a precious work of art, he sued to get the $100,000 or for return of the etching. The buyer defended by alleging that the seller did not act reasonably to protect himself by knowing what he was selling.

Under the restatement of contracts and the majority rule in case law, will the court grant the buyers motion to dismiss the seller's complaint?

A. Yes, the seller should have had the items appraised before selling them. The seller always must know the value of what is being offered for sale.
B. Yes, the seller cannot rescind a contract just because he later regrets it. Either party may end up with a superior deal depending on luck, knowledge, and a variety of factors.
C. No, because in some unilateral mistakes, rescission is allowed if there had been an unconscionably unequal exchange of values and there is no substantial hardship to the other party.
D. No, because a party always has a right to rescind a contract where the value of the product or services does not live up to his reasonable expectation.

Question #023.
OA68: Did Aaron Hernandez Cash In By Committing Suicide? (w/guest Chris Kristofco)

A young woman joined a social media service that provided networking with other business professionals and entities nationwide. The woman discovered that the service was selling her personal profile information and the information pertaining to thousands of other members to third-party purchasers for tracking their Internet activities and buying habits. In her class action breach of contract action against the service, she alleged two theories of damages. First, she contended that she and the class members suffered, quote, embarrassment and humiliation from the disclosure. And second, that she and the others must be compensated for the market value of the information seized.

Will the court likely recognize these allegations as sufficient to state a claim for breach of contract?

A. Yes, because the service breached the duty of good faith inherent in every contract.
B. Yes, because these are common types of damages that are authorized in breach of contract cases.
C. No, because Internet laws protect absolutely all communications and downloads of this nature as a part of the service's guaranteed scope of free speech rights.
D. No, because humiliation is not an item of damages in a breach of contract case, and the unauthorized collection of personal data does not establish an economic loss.

Question #024.

A. Yes, because it is an exception to hearsay as a spontaneous declaration to an opponent party.
B. Yes, because the building owner can testify and be questioned about what the janitor told him.
C. No, because it is irrelevant and immaterial.
D. No, because it is hearsay within hearsay, and there are no hearsay exceptions that apply.

Question #025.
OA72: Body Slamming Journalists PLUS Political vs. Racial Gerrymandering

A vehicle operator was driving on a highway at night. His girlfriend was in the passenger seat. They were returning from a college night class. She was smoking marijuana, blowing it out the open window and not sharing it with the driver. The driver fell asleep, causing the car to veer off the highway and go into a ditch where it landed upside down. Both the driver and the passenger were seriously injured. She sued the operator for negligence. The operator filed a counterclaim asking for damages against the passenger by arguing that the passenger was herself negligent by smoking weed and causing him to fall asleep.

Is the court likely to grant the passengers motion to dismiss the counterclaim?

A. Yes, because the passenger was not actively participating in a joint enterprise and did not do enough to contribute to the cause of the accident.
B. Yes, because a vehicle operator is always liable and a passenger cannot be made liable for the driver's actions under any circumstances.
C. No, because the driver has properly alleged a joint enterprise situation where the passenger is liable for her share of the negligence in causing the accident.
D. No, because the passenger was breaking the law, making her negligent per se.

Question #026.
OA74: Sippinâ€™ #Covfefe With Trumpâ€™s Severed Head

A purse snatcher ran up to a woman grabbed her purse and ran off there was a witness at the scene the witness worked with the police a few days later to try and create a composite sketch of the purse snatcher boy that is a tough word to say. This was used by the police to capture the purported purse stature. The witness died several days before the trial.

When the witness's drawing was offered by the prosecution as evidence at trial, is the trial judge likely to accept it as admissible evidence?

A. Yes, because the police took it and used it to find someone. Therefore, it must be an accurate representation of the perpetrator. The exhibit must be admitted.
B. Yes, because it is in the nature of the written recollection of the decedent, at a time close to the crime, and therefore has testimonial reliability.
C. No, because the defense has had no opportunity to cross-examine the witness under oath about the drawing prior to her death, and such sketches are inherently unreliable in any event.
D. No, because it was drawn up days after the event and is in violation of the best evidence rule.

Question #027.
OA76: "I Hope" James Comeyâ€™s Senate Testimony Shows Obstruction of Justice

A man was a passenger in a vehicle stopped at a red light. A drunk driver with a blood alcohol reading four times the legal limit rammed into the rear of the stopped vehicle without breaking and at a high speed. The passenger was severely and permanently injured. At trial, the drunk driver admitted liability so that the trial dealt with damages only. The drunk driver testified that he had no assets to pay a punitive damages award. He said that all he had was $100,000 in liability coverage. The court allowed the injured man's attorney to cross-examine the driver about his insurance coverage, and he elicited an admission that the driver knew that his company might have to pay the full award of the jury. The jury entered a verdict for $200,000 in compensatory damages and $500,000 in punitive damages.

Defendant appeals, claiming that it was improper to question on the amount of insurance coverage or to speculate on whether the full amount may have to be paid.

Will the appellate court likely affirm the award of punitive damages?

A. No. The punitive damages award cannot be excessively high and cannot exceed three times the compensatory damages amount.
B. No, because it is never proper to bring insurance information into the case against the defendant.
C. Yes, because defendant opened the door to that kind of cross-examination by testifying that he had no assets to pay a punitive damage award.
D. Yes, because the jury always has a right to be informed of the insurance coverage pertaining to each party in a tort case for personal injury damages.

Question #028.
OA78: Jeff Sessions, "Preemptive Executive Privilege," & More on Emoluments

An owner of a pizza and Italian foods restaurant opens a new location on a street where another owner has a burger restaurant. It seems like business is slow for the pizza place owner and he eyes up his competitor, the burger man, as the reason. The pizza owner starts to make false statements about the burger restaurant and its inferior ingredients, which he says have been causing domain poisoning in some of the customers.

When the burger joint owner loses customers and business income to the pizza place owner, can he sue for conversion?

A. Yes, because the pizza owner interfered with his right of peaceful enjoyment and disrupted his business activities.
B. Yes, conversion is an intentional tort and the pizza owner acted intentionally to convert and did convert part of the burger business.
C. No, because conversion consists of appropriating another's real property.
D. No, because there was no interference with his ownership or right of possession to his personal property.

Question #029.
OA80: Flashback Friday (featuring Health Care, The Slants, and Gerrymandering!)

At a metro station in the city, there's always significant construction going on, including a rebuild of the elevator shaft between the platform and the ground level. There's a sign warning, "This elevator is not available at this time. Please do not ride it." A passenger sees the signs but tries to ride the elevator anyway and is injured when she falls into the shaft. When the passenger sues the city for negligence, the city states that she assumed the risk.

Is that a valid and accurate defense under the circumstances?

A. Yes, because she was fully informed and should have known that the elevator was unsafe based on the signs.
B. Yes, because the signs make her contributorily negligent and a legal cause of her own injury.
C. No, because the sign did not explain the danger and only told her that it was not available and therefore she did not know what she was encountering.
D. No, because the city has strict liability when everyone is depending on the subway. Okay, okay.

Question #030.
OA82: Trinity Lutheran, Trumpâ€™s Executive Order & More (w/guest Andrew Seidel)

A teenage male was on trial on charges of illegally entering an owner's property and stealing a car. The witness can only confirm for the prosecution that a car was stolen, the model and type of car, and that it was missing from the property on a date certain. The defense asks the witness, isn't it possible that my client did not steal the car, that someone else did it, and that the police are lying about the charges against him? The prosecution objected to the question.

Will the court likely sustain the objection?

A. Yes, because this is an objectionable question based on pure speculation.
B. Yes, because it is not permissible to question the credibility of the police without substantial supporting evidence.
C. No, questioning about the possibility of other perpetrators or about police misconduct is always permissible.
D. No, because the witness may know something that he is not revealing, and for that reason a cross examiner is given wide latitude in questioning.

Question #031.
OA84: #CNNBlackmail, John Oliverâ€™s lawsuit, and more on Maajid Nawaz

The buyer asked a manufacturer to make him 100,000 widgets for $1 million. The buyer intended to retail them by mail order sales. The widgets had to have the buyer's logo imprinted on them. Manufacturer ordered the raw material and made a new widget mold that contained the buyer's logo. The buyer wanted quick delivery of at least 10,000 widgets right away. So the manufacturer rushed the order and sent 10,000 conforming widgets two days later. The buyer paid for the widgets but rejected, so the 10,000 widgets, but rejected delivery on the remaining 90,000 widgets. The manufacturer filed suit and claimed damages for breach of contract. The defendant buyer filed a cross motion to dismiss the complaint on the basis that the statute of frauds was violated in that it was a contract for over $500 that was unenforceable under state law.

Will the court likely grant the motion to dismiss?

A. Yes, the statute of frauds must be enforced when it involves goods over $500.
B. Yes, the manufacturer did not protect its interests by agreeing to an oral contract, and it must pay for its bad business practices.
C. No, because there is an exception for goods that are specially made for a buyer.
D. No, the law will enforce the benefit of the bargain rule.

Question #032.
OA86: If Donald Trump, Jr. Commits Treason, Is It A Mini-Yodel?

Two women lived in a one bedroom house with 20 cats. A neighbor who entered the house was appalled by their deplorable living conditions. The animal's excrement was deposited throughout the house. They were kept in tiny pens and some of the animals were sick. The visitor called the SPCA, a private nonprofit humane society. State law authorized humane societies to receive abused or neglected animals from animal control officers, care for them, and adopt them out. The SPCA took the animals designated by the officers and the officers then arrested the women for animal neglect. At a hearing, the prosecutor was unprepared and the judge dismissed the charges. The women then sued the officers and the SPCA under 42 USC 1983 for civil rights violations. The SPCA defendants filed a motion to dismiss based on the absence of state action on their part.

Will the court likely grant the motion to dismiss?

A. Yes, because there was nothing that was done by the Humane Society that involved police action.
B. Yes, because the SPCA personnel did not at any time act "under color of law in their actions".
C. No, because the SPCA was organized under a non-profit certificate of incorporation that was issued by the state.
D. No, because the SPCA acted under the authority of state statute and cooperated with state authorities to perform the authorized functions.

Question #033.
OA88: Noahâ€™s Ark & How Private Is The Stuff You Do On Your Computer?

A small town police officer pulled over a driver for speeding. He believed that the driver was acting irritable and fidgy but had no articulable reason to think anything was wrong. He searched the car anyway and found two cartons of freshly canned peaches which were owned by the driver's neighbor and recorded stolen off her porch 24 hours earlier. Authorities charged him with theft under the state criminal code. His motion to suppress the evidence because of an unlawful search was denied.

On appeal, will the appellate court likely reverse the lower court decision denying the motion to suppress?

A. Yes, because the search was unconstitutional due to the officer having no reasonable suspicion that would justify searching the car.
B. Yes, because when a car is pulled over for speeding, the officer must always obtain a search warrant prior to making a search.
C. No, the stop and search were within the normal bounds of propriety for a speeding stop.
D. No, because the driver being fidgety is enough for probable cause for a full search of the vehicle.

Question #034.
OA90: Pardon Me? Yes, Donald Trump Can Pardon Himself

A college student attended a fraternity party. He noticed a young woman flirting with him in a sexually suggestive way. He took her home and ended up forcefully raping her against her will. She escaped after the rape and went directly to the authorities. The police filed charges of rape. The student defendant found several men willing to testify that the woman was promiscuous, that they had relations with her, and that she was very prolific in her sexual life.

Will the trial court likely permit the witnesses to testify to the woman's sexual predisposition under the federal rules of evidence?

A. Yes, because the rules permit evidence of a victim's sexual predisposition to test credibility.
B. Yes, because the evidence will help the jury see that there may be two sides to the story and that the woman was thus the sexual predator instead of the man.
C. No, because such sexual predisposition evidence is generally prohibited by the rules of evidence except under narrow exceptions.
D. No, because the rules of evidence prohibit all evidence of a victim's prior sexual history.

Question #035.
OA92: The Unfortunate Application of Statutes of Limitation and Davino Watson

A man who was emotionally upset due to marital problems voluntarily checked into a private medical facility for treatment. State law provided that if he tried to leave against medical advice, the hospital could hold him for 72 hours while trying to convince him to stay. During the stay, he told his medical providers that he was intensely angry at his wife, who was living with another man, and he wanted to harm her. Despite that knowledge, the hospital issued him an unrestricted weekend pass. When he got out, he shot and killed his wife. The man's children sued the hospital for negligence. The hospital filed a motion to dismiss, mainly because there was no privity with the decedent and no duty owed to her.

Will the court grant the motion to dismiss?

A. No, because the hospital is strictly liable for releasing patients who it knows or should know represent an unreasonable danger to third persons.
B. No, because the special relationship and the control between doctor and an inpatient mandates due care by the doctor to prevent a foreseeable danger to others.
C. Yes, because there is no duty to control the conduct of another person to prevent that person from harming others.
D. Yes, because the intervening acts of third parties are unforeseeable and cannot give rise to liability.

Question #036.
OA94: Geoff Blackwell, Trumpâ€™s Anti-Trans Tweets & the Google Manifesto

A man published a website wherein he billed himself as a crusader for justice and a hero with special powers. He wrote mainly about consumer issues while acting like a watchdog exposing wrongdoers. He wrote one article about a female preacher who had a local blog on the Internet. He wrote that she was "conspiring with the devil" to figure out how to, "lead people's minds astray", and to live a nice, "sheltered role of pure moral superiority at the expense of inferiors" like himself and his readers. He called the woman's fashion medieval and her hairstyle was like a bag of, "hot wires ready to electrocute anyone who dares come too close".

The preacher was not amused and she filed a defamation action claiming libel per se and demanding damages along with an injunction against the website. The defendant filed a motion to dismiss.

Will the court likely grant the motion to dismiss?

A. Yes, because the defendant was expressing opinions more than factual assertions, and opinions in this context are constitutionally protected.
B. Yes, because statements about religious beliefs or practices cannot be the subject of private defamation actions.
C. No, because the preacher's allegations are based on serious factual distortions that will destroy her career if she doesn't get protection.
D, No, because a defamation action cannot be subject to a motion to dismiss. The plaintiff is always entitled to present evidence to prove the tort.

Question #037.
OA96: Understanding Charlottesville

A retailer agreed to purchase an orchard's total cherry production for a 12 month period. The contract included this provision, "terms, cash upon delivery, deliveries to be made at least twice per month". The deliveries went as scheduled. At the beginning of the fifth month, the orchard sent notice to the retailer that a load of cherries was ready to pick up. The truck driver, however, forgot to take the retailer's check with him. The orchard turned over the cherries but advised the retailer to pay within three days. The retailer sent the check by mail, but it arrived late by two days. The orchard refused to deliver any more cherries. The retailer sued the orchard for breach of the installment contract and demanded the difference in price between the cherries on the open market and what he would have paid under the contract. The orchard claimed that the delayed payment impaired the value of the contract and moved to dismiss.

Will the court grant the orchard's motion to dismiss?

A. Yes, the agreement called for cash at delivery, which was not done when the driver forgot to deliver the check.
B. Yes, the failure to make an installment on time was a breach because time is of the essence in all installment agreements.
C. No, there is always a grace period of 10 days for any single payment pertaining to an installment contract.
D. No, the delay in one payment under these facts was not enough to impair the value of the contract under the uniform commercial code.

Question #038.
OA98: More Sovereign Citizen Madness!

A witness in a murder case does not make the same statement faithfully, but rather he is given different versions of his observations at different times to different persons and investigators. The prosecution put the witness on the stand at trial to tell what he observed. The defendant's counsel impeached his testimony by bringing up prior inconsistent statements and accusing him of changing his story for trial. The prosecution then attempted to rehabilitate his credibility by referencing prior consistent statements. Prior consistent statements are not generally admissible because they are said to be repetitive, cumulative, and to unfairly bolster the witness's credibility.

Will the court likely allow the prosecution to rehabilitate the witness using prior consistent statements under these facts?

A. No, because the witness cannot be rehabilitated once a successful impeachment has occurred.
B. No, because it would tend to confuse the jury with too much conflicting evidence.
C. Yes, because it is being used to rehabilitate a witness whose credibility was attacked.
D. Yes, because all repetitive prior statements are important to show the consistency of the witness's testimony.

Question #039.
OA100: Trumpâ€™s Trans Ban & Arpaio Pardon

A foreign visitor was on trial for kidnapping a small child. The prosecutor stated that the visitor knew the child personally, which is why the child went with him, and that the perpetrator knew the child's parents had money. The prosecutor called a witness to testify that the perpetrator told the witness, I am looking forward to visiting with this child and his parents. They have a wonderfully luxurious house that I will enjoy staying in. The defense objected to the proposed testimony.

Will the court likely sustain the objection?

A. No, the statement is admissible to impeach the accused and establish that he is lying on cross if he takes the stand.
B. No, the statement can come in as impeachment if the accused takes the stand and as a party admission to show the material facts of knowing the child and that the family had money.
C. Yes, the prejudice of the statement will outweigh its probative value.
D. Yes, the statement is irrelevant to the issue of guilt or innocence.

Question #040.
OA102: The Utah Nurse, DACA, & Disaster Relief

The state charged the accused with the intentional murder of a former girlfriend. He admitted to killing her, but asserted that he lacked the intent to murder due to his suffering from a personality disorder complicated by two days of drinking alcohol heavily. The trial judge instructed the jury that, "the law presumes that a person intends the ordinary consequences of his voluntary acts". The judge did not tell them that they had a choice or could infer another conclusion. They were told only that the law presumed it. The accused was convicted of depraved heart murder and sentenced to 100 years in prison. On appeal, the appellant argued that the court took the fact-finding task of determining criminal intent out of the jury's hands by in effect ordering them to find intent.

The jury could have felt that they were being told that they had no other choice. The State Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, but the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari.

Will the court likely reverse the conviction?

A. Yes, court will likely reverse the conviction because the wording of the instruction could have been viewed by jurors as a mandatory direction to find that there was intent to murder.
B. Yes, because the wording in effect caused the defendant to be a witness against himself by having him intend everything that he did.
C. No, because the defendant could raise an argument to rebut the permissible inference created by the jury instruction.
D. No, because the instruction was only a presumption that the jury did not have to consider in its deliberations. So I think this is a really, really tough question.

Question #041.
OA104: Equifax, Class Actions, Sham Marriages & Redistricting!

A detective found a footprint from a left foot shoe at a murder scene. The print was preserved appropriately as evidence. It had distinctive tread marks and an unusual wear pattern on the sole. It also had a V mark on the heel bottom that indicates the brand was a Victory shoe. The detective, armed with a proper search warrant, searched the suspect's apartment where he found a shoe to a right foot of the same size with a similar wear pattern and the same V mark as the shoe print found at the scene. The shoe for the left foot was not found, but the shoe for the right foot was seized from the suspect's closet and offered as evidence at trial.

Is this admissible evidence?

A. Yes, because it is direct evidence of guilt.
B. Yes, because it is appropriate circumstantial evidence of guilt.
C. No, because the shoe is irrelevant and will have no residue or other probative evidence relating to it.
D. No, because footprint evidence is highly speculative unless both shoes and shoe prints are offered and authenticated.

Question #042.
OA 106: Elections Have Consequences! Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders & the DNC Lawsuit

A man who was reportedly a renowned art thief, was on trial for stealing several Picasso's from a museum. The paintings had been recovered and were in the courtroom. The prosecution presented a professor of art history to authenticate each piece. The defense objected on the basis that the museum curator, where the paintings were housed, had to identify if these were in fact the paintings that were stolen.

Assuming that others will testify to the fact of the burglary is the court likely to reject this witness?

A. Yes, because artworks and other physical evidence must be authenticated by their official custodian.
B. Yes, because an outside person may be able to partially authenticate the painting, but he can't say whether it was the one that was in the museum or that was stolen.
C. No, granting the objection will simply waste the court's time if the court has to bring in the museum curator and go through hoops to authenticate the paintings.
D. No, because the authentication can be accomplished in several different ways that will verify it is the genuine piece of art in question.

Question #043.
OA108: State-Sponsored Patriotism In the NFL & So Much More!

The president and sole stockholder of a small business negotiated to sell that business to an individual investor. The parties met and signed a "letter agreement, which set forth the price down payment amount, financing terms, the assets to be included, and a host of other pertinent details". The final closing date was not stated, but the purchasers left a down payment of $20,000 with the seller. The letter stated that the terms comprised their essential agreement, but that a formal document would be drafted by the party's attorneys. Before that happened, the seller returned the check and refused to perform. The investor brought an equity action for specific performance to compel the sale. The equity court ruled that there was a complete and binding contract that must be specifically performed.

Will the appellate court likely affirm the lower court's decision?

A. No, because the closing date was left out and the attorneys were supposed to compose the final contract with all the remaining details put in.
B. No because this type of letter is basically a gentleman's agreement that is not intended to be legally binding and
C. Yes, because a letter of intent is legally binding if it sets forth the price, describes the business, and is signed by both parties.
D. Yes, because where the letter contains all the essential terms required for a contract, it will be enforced as a contract.

Question #044.
OA110: Gun Control After Las Vegas & Two Trips To Yodel Mountain

A female employee was fired as an executive assistant at the time when she was seven months pregnant. She brought a Title VII civil rights action in federal court for gender discrimination against the employer. At trial, a former co-worker of the woman was not allowed to testify that she heard the human relations manager saying in an informal meeting that the plaintiff and her predecessor were both fired due to what the manager described as, "pregnancy complications". The proposed witness had been a vice president of the company and a close advisor to the president. Without the benefit of that vital testimony, the jury entered a verdict for the defendant employer. On appeal, the plaintiff argued that the testimony should have been allowed and that it was not hearsay under the federal rules.

Will the court likely grant the appeal and order a new trial?

A. No, because the statement is clearly hearsay with no exception to the hearsay rule being applicable.
B. No, because it was based on things the coworker heard from others, making it double hearsay that is never admissible.
C. Yes, because that kind of testimony is reliable and not excludable as hearsay.
D. Yes, because it was admissible under the spontaneous utterance exception to the hearsay rules.

Question #045.
OA112: Whoâ€™s Afraid of the FCC?

The owner of a state licensed massage parlor sued the state for arbitrarily canceling its license and prior business permits to conduct a massage parlor at a given location in the city. Due to allegations of illegal activities in other massage parlors in the city, the owner's personal license and the business permits were revoked. The only procedure provided was a letter from the city declaring a new policy on massage parlors that had to be rapidly instituted for the welfare of the community. She sued the city and federal court, claiming that her business had been taken without just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment's takings clause. She also claimed a lack of procedural due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. The court granted a motion to dismiss based on her not having a property interest that was affected, including in the license and permits.

She appealed the decision. Will the Federal Court of Appeals affirm the lower court's dismissal of her case?

A. Yes, the Federal Court of Appeals will affirm the lower court's dismissal, saying that she has no case, because there is no right to earn a living under the substantive due process clause.
B. Yes, because the state interest in protecting the public from illegal activities required that state action that was taken.
C. No, because once the parlor had opened with all the proper permits, it could not be deprived of its licenses for any reason until they were up for renewal.
D. No, because she had a property right in her license and permits, which were taken without any procedural due process.

Question #046.
OA114: Presidential Powers - Obamacare and the Travel Ban

Two people who have been cohabiting decide to get married. The man asks the woman to agree that all of his property that he now owns will remain in his name if they ever get divorced. She agrees to that but demands a written document. However, they got married without having signed anything. Three months later, the husband leaves the wife for another woman. He sends her notice to vacate the home due to their prenuptial agreement. When she doesn't move, the husband sues, asking for enforcement of the oral prenuptial contract.

Will the court likely enforce the husband's claim?

A. Yes, because the consideration for the contract was the marriage and the consummation of the marriage made the contract complete and enforceable.
B. Yes, because prenuptial agreements are given the benefit of the doubt when it comes to enforcement decisions.
C. No, because a contract in consideration of marriage must be in writing and the prenuptial was therefore not legal as long as it remained oral.
D. No, because husband did not live up to his promise to put the agreement in writing and therefore was guilty of fraud.

Question #047.
OA116: Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump & The Russians - Election Law (w/guest Beth Kingsley)

A tenant's four-year-old daughter fell from a second floor outdoor stairway at their apartment building. The tenant sued the landlord for negligent construction and maintenance of the stairway, steps, and railing. The stairs were built on a dangerously steep incline, the steps were loose, and the railing was insufficient to keep the baby from falling over the side. The jury found that the landlord was negligent in the design and construction of the stairs and in failing to maintain the stairs, steps, and railing in a safe condition. The landlord appealed on the basis of immunity from suit and the failure of the tenant to assert any exception to landlord immunity.

Under the modern rule, will the appellate court affirm the jury's verdict against the landlord?

A. Yes, the landlord is strictly liable for the abnormally dangerous condition that he knowingly allowed to exist.
B. Yes, the modern rule is that the landlord, like anyone else, has a duty to use due care to protect its tenants and others from injury caused by a foreseeable risk of harm.
C. No, because the landlord still enjoys the common law protection of the doctrine of laissez-b'ouir, and residential property is generally still rented as is.
D. No, because a landlord cannot be held liable for negligent design or maintenance even under the modern rule.

Question #048.
OA118: Indictment Monday & the View From Yodel Mountain

Several persons together stole a painting from an art museum. One of them, who was the driver, was caught during the commission of another crime. He told the police, I didn't even get any money from that art museum. It all went to the first guy and the second guy.

When the first guy and the second guy go on trial for the theft of the art painting, is the driver's statement admissible in court?

A. Yes, as an admission by a party opponent.
B. Yes, as a statement against the interests of the other defendants.
C. No, because it was made while in custody and is therefore unreliable.
D. No, because the statement was not made in the course of or in furtherance of the conspiracy and thus it is hearsay.

Question #049.
OA120: OA Shills For Monsanto! (w/guest Natalie Newell of "Science Moms")

A furniture dealer sold furniture to a young couple with less than perfect credit. I like the commercial start of this. They signed a contract that said that if they purchased new items on the account, they would not own the old purchases until the new ones were paid in full. That provision was in fine print on the reverse side of the papers. When the husband lost his job, they had by that time paid for everything purchased on the account, except for one share bought a few weeks earlier. The store sued, trying to repossess all the furniture ever sold to the couple.

Will the couple likely prevail on a defense of unconscionability?

A. No, because they might be able to find another store to sell them furniture, which proves that there was no lack of bargaining power.
B. No, because the store was nice enough to extend credit and the couple should be expected to pay for everything before they own any of it. That's the libertarian answer.
C. Yes, because any time a seller puts terms in fine print, it is proof of bad faith and unconscionability.
D. Yes, because under a combination of factors, makes it likely that the court will recognize unconscionability under these circumstances.

Question #050.
OA122: Moore is Less

Cruiser and Flash were driving down Main Street in their distinctively painted, carefully restored old American automobiles, when Cruiser's vehicle bumped lightly into Flash's car, scraping away some paint. Cruiser and Flash both got out of their cars and examined the damage, after which Flash made some disparaging remarks about Cruiser's car. Cruiser slapped Flash in the face. Flash punched Cruiser in the nose. Cruiser seized Flash and a half Nelson and started to ram Flash's head into the side of Flash's car. At this moment, Flash's brother, Glitter, leaped from his car, pulled a knife, held it to Cruiser's throat saying, let him go or I'll cut you.

Cruiser released flash, but subsequently sued glitter for assault.

What is the result?

A. Cruiser wins because Glitter threatened him with deadly force.
B. Cruiser wins unless Ramming Flash's head into a car is considered a deadly attack.
C. Glitter wins because Cruiser started the fight by slapping Flash.
D. Glitter wins because he and Flash are relatives.

Question #051.
OA124: Happy Thanksgiving!

A law of the state of Tentucky provides that all persons who have been residents of Tentucky for more than three years shall be entitled to free tuition at state-supported institutions of higher education. It further provides the persons who have resided in Tentucky for three years or less shall pay the non resident tuition rate, which is four thousand dollars per year.

The book is written on golden plates. Sebastian was a student at Kentucky State University and a resident of Kentucky for a little more than two years. Sebastian was annoyed that he was required to pay tuition and filed a class action suit on behalf of himself and other university students with less than three years residency in federal district court for a declaratory judgment as to the constitutionality of the Kentucky statute. In eight months, when the case actually came to trial, Sebastian had been a resident of Kentucky for more than three years and was not required to pay tuition at the state university. However, Sebastian's case generated a great deal of interest and a number of amicus curiae briefs were filed with the court, some of them supporting and some of them opposing Sebastian's position.

Should the state's motion to dismiss the case be granted?

A. Yes, because Sebastian is now a three-year resident.
B. Yes, because Sebastian lacks standing.
C. No, because amicus curiae briefs have been filed.
D. No, because there is a live controversy.

Question #052.
OA126: Mick Mulvaney & The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau

Congress passed a law imposing a 50% excise tax on each pack of cigarettes manufactured for sale in the United States. An amendment was successfully added to the original bill requiring that all proceeds from the tax be used for anti-smoking educational programs in audio, video, and print media and elsewhere. The amendment also provided for the establishment of federal stop-smoking clinics funded through the excise tax. The various tobacco companies were required to pay the tax directly to the federal government. Puffham Tobacco Company filed suit in the appropriate federal court, praying that the tax be struck down as unconstitutional.

The court is likely to rule:

A. The tax is constitutional because the tax is severable from its purpose.
B. The tax is constitutional because the broad provisions of the general welfare clause would condone it.
C. The tax is unconstitutional because it does not provide equal time for the tobacco companies to present their side of the smoking controversy.
D. The tax is unconstitutional because it abridges the First Amendment rights of tobacco manufacturers by forcing them to pay for messages they may not agree with.

Question #053.
OA128: Antitrust, Part Two

During the course of his trial for assault, Danny placed professional sociologist Sato on the stand. Sato testified that he had scientifically pulled the community in which Danny lived and that Danny had a high reputation for being a peaceable man in a rather rough community. On cross-examination, the prosecutor asks Sato: "isn't it true, Mr. Sato, that last year you filed a false income tax return"? The defense immediately objected.

Should the court require Sato to answer the question posed to him?

A. Yes, but only if Sato has been convicted of filing a false tax return.
B. Yes, because the question is relevant to the truthfulness and credibility of the witness.
C. No, because specific instances of conduct are inadmissible.
D. No, because the question does not go to a relevant character trait.

Question #054.
OA130: California on Fire

Pluto went to Amy, an attorney, who agreed to file suit on his behalf on a contingent fee basis. Very common practice. Amy sent Pluto to see Dr. Sawbones, a physician, for the purpose of examining Pluto prior to trial and assessing the extent of his injuries. During the course of the examination, Pluto made some statements to Sawbones indicating that he was not completely free from negligence when the accident occurred. Duck seeks to call Sawbones to testify to the statements Pluto made to Sawbones. Amy objects.

The objection by Amy should be:

A. Overruled because Pluto made an admission.
B. Overruled because a physician qualifies as an expert witness.
C. Sustained because the attorney-client privilege applies.
D. Sustained because the physician-patient privilege applies.

Question #055.
OA132: The Thomas Show! Can He Serve on the Federal Bench? Why is His High School Crazy? & More!

Ted asked Steve if he could borrow Steve's boat for a day cruise. Steve agreed, but instructed Ted to stay inside the bay. Ted cruised around the bay, then, because the ocean was so calm outside the bay, crossed a mile of open ocean to the Blue Oyster Bar on the docks at Santa Patagonia Island. While Ted was docked, another boat passed the dock at an illegally excessive speed and its wake washed onto Steve's boat, causing water damage to the upholstery of about $150. Ted returned the boat directly to Steve without further incident.

What, if any, recovery can Steve have against Ted resulting from Ted's use of Steve's boat?

A. Steve can recover nothing because Ted was not responsible for the water damage to the upholstery.
B. Steve can recover the cost of repairing the upholstery because it was damaged when Ted took the boat out of the bay.
C. Steve can recover the value of the boat because Ted was in dominion and control of the boat when it was damaged.
D. Steve can recover the value of the boat since Ted violated his instructions about staying in the bay.

OA136: Chevron Deference Has Consequences - Particularly For Paul Manafort!

Guy was hiking in the High Sierra in April, when a severe late season blizzard set in. He became lost in the snow and wandered for several hours trying to follow whimpering creek downstream. Fortunately, he came across a small seemingly unoccupied cabin, which he entered for shelter by breaking the lock and then fell asleep.

Several hours later Basil, the owner of the cabin, roared up on his snowmobile and finding Guy in the Cabin demanded that Guy leave. When Guy refused, pointing out that the storm as at its peak, Basil dragged Guy out into the snow and then closed and locked the door.

Utterly by chance, Guy managed to find another cabin, but suffered severe frostbite leading to the loss of several toes.

If Guy sues Basil who will win?

A) Basil, because Guy refused to leave when asked.
B) Guy, because Basil did not behave as a reasonable person under the circumstances.
C) Guy, because the blizzard was a life threatening situation.
D) Basil, because Guy damaged his Cabin.

Question #058.
OA138: Pot, Gerrymandering, and Net Neutrality

Like millions of other Americans, Bueller was anxious to purchase one of the new Mitsusushi two-way wrist videophones, the Walk and Talk Man. He went to the Electron Store, a chain retailer of consumer electronic devices, to purchase one. The Electron Store paid $1,500 to the factory for the Walk and Talk Man and charged its customers $2,500. Each Walk and Talk Man had to be ordered from the factory in Japan. Orders were so plentiful that it was taking up to eight weeks to receive the devices after ordering.

An Electron Store salesperson filled out a pre-printed form, which had been drafted by the Electron Store's corporate legal department, in which Bueller agreed to make a $300 down payment and to pay the remaining $2,200 upon delivery of the Walk and Talk Man to him. Bueller, as is customary for consumers in these cases, signed the form without reading it. When Bueller's Walk and Talk Man arrived from Japan six weeks later, Bueller refused to accept it and demanded his $300 down payment back. The Electron store immediately sold that Walk and Talk Man for $2,500 to Calistoga, who had also ordered one from the factory on the same terms as Bueller. The Electron store then brought an action for breach of contract against Bueller, who counterclaimed for the return of his $300.

What will be the likely outcome of this action?
A. Judgment for Bueller in the amount of $300, because the purchase agreement was an unconscionable adhesion contract.
B. Judgment for the Electron Store for the incidental costs of sale, since it resold the Walk and Talk Man at no loss to itself.
C. Judgment for the Electron Store in the amount of $700, plus reasonable overhead and incidental costs, because under the circumstances, loss of profit is the only measure of damages which will make the Electron Store whole.
D. Judgment for the Electron store in the amount of $2,200 because it could sell every Walk and Talk man it could obtain from the factory.

OA140: DACA and More!

John and Mary were camping just south of a river in the National Forest when a forest fighter was ignited nearby by lightning. In order to avoid the flames, John swam across the river and untied a canoe from a no trespassing sign. One of many were stuck in the riverbank about every 100 feet.

In his haste, John destroyed the sign in freeing the canoe. John paddled the canoe back across the river to get buried. John and Mary headed west, hoping to find a public road. Ogre, the owner of the property, was out practicing his bow hunting skills when he saw the couple and assumed they were intending to camp on his land. An accomplished woodsman, Ogre trailed them. Intending to frighten them so that they would leave and not return, Ogre shot an arrow so that it would pass in front of the two campers and "thwack!" into the tree just before they walked by. At the moment of release, however, another lightning strike occurred very close by, startling Ogre so that his arrow passed closer than he had intended, narrowly missing Mary and hitting and cutting John's hand.

Can Ogre recover for the damage done to his no trespassing sign?

A. No, because John was privileged to enter onto Ogre's land to escape the forest fire.
B. No, because the damage to Ogre's property was de minimis.
C. Yes, because John was a trespasser.
D. Yes, because John destroyed the sign.

OA146: Clearing the White Board!

For many years, Schnauzer, a supplier of dog food, had accepted orders for dog food from Chow, the owner of a pet store, over the telephone. One day, Chow telephoned Schnauzer and ordered 840 pound bags of dog food, priced at $20 per bag, to be delivered to his store at the rate of 100 per month starting in January. On January 1, Schnauzer delivered 100 bags. With his check-in payment for the delivery, Chow sent Schnauzer a note saying, "$20 per bag is too high. I will not take the other 700 bags signed Chow". Schnauzer files suit alleging that Chow promised to buy 800 bags of dog food from him. In his defense, Chow pleads the statute of frauds.

How should the court rule on this issue?

A. For Schnauzer, because the note sent with Chao's check constitutes a writing sufficient to satisfy the statute of frauds.
B. For Chao because the note sent with Chao's check was a repudiation rather than a memorandum of the oral agreement.
C. For Chao because the note sent with Chao's check does not satisfy the Statute of Frauds.
D. For Schnauzer because Chao received and accepted part of the goods.

OA150: Janus, The Angry Roman God Of Doorways (And Labor Law?)

Dubba's old Basenji Reb didn't like the new puppy and would hide from him during the day so as not to have his (Reb's) naps interrupted by an impromptu game of chew Reb's ear.

One warm evening, the dog Reb hid in the tool shed and was so deeply asleep that he didn't awaken when Dubba, the owner, shut and locked the shed for the night. When he, again  woke about midnight and discovered that he was locked in, Reb began jumping against the shed door. The loud banging of the tool shed door aroused Dubba from sleep. Thinking that his house was being burglarized, Dubba grabbed his loaded shotgun and tiptoed onto the back patio from where he heard the loud banging. In the dark of the patio, Dubba did not notice that his young daughter had left her jacks scattered about on the floor. When his bare feet encountered the jacks, Dubba was soon hopping in pain and fell over a patio table, crashing heavily to the floor.

Upon impact, the shotgun went off, both barrels blasting a hole in the patio screen. The pellet struck Dubba's neighbor Jimmy, who had also heard the thumping in the tool shed, and climbed over the fence which separated his yard from Dubba's, and Jimmy was killed instantly.

Which of the following is Dubba's strongest defense to a charge of involuntary manslaughter as a result of Jimmy's death?

A. Jimmy assumed the risk by trespassing on Dubba's property at night.
B. Dubba's actions that night did not constitute criminal negligence.
C. Jimmy's death did not result from a volitional act by Dubba.

OA152: Discrimination is for Dickâ€™s?

Daphne was a committed vegan, eating only plant-derived foods. One night, in order to dramatize the unhealthy nature of meat and to draw attention to the slaughter of innocent animals, Daphne went to the butcher's section of the supermarket, where she was employed as a produce manager, and sprinkled a nausea-inducing chemical on all the meat, fowl, and fish products. Despite being careful, Daphne accidentally put too much powder in one package of hamburger. When the woman who bought it served it to her family, her husband, who was unusually susceptible, died as a result of ingesting the chemical. In Daphne's jurisdiction, murder is defined as "the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought. Such malice may be expressed or implied. It is expressed where there is manifested a deliberate intention unlawfully to take away the life of another person. It is implied when no considerable provocation appears or when the circumstances attending the killing show an abandoned and malignant heart".

All murder which is perpetrated by willful, deliberate, or premeditated killing, or which is committed in the perpetration of or attempt to perpetrate arson, rape, robbery, or burglary, is murder of the first degree. All other kinds of murders are of the second degree.

If prosecuted for the criminal homicide of the husband who ate the tainted meat, Daphne should be found guilty of:

A. First degree murder since she willfully, deliberately, and with premeditation killed the victim.
B. First degree murder since the homicide occurred during the perpetration of a felony.
C. Second degree murder since the circumstances show that she acted with an abandoned and malignant heart and let the record show that the circumstances also show that whoever wrote these bar questions did not intend for them to be read aloud.
D. Involuntary manslaughter since she did not intend to kill anyone.

OA154: Stormy Daniels is a Legal Genius

When the 20-year incumbent in the State Senate district representing her city retired, Judith, a city council member, filed as a candidate for that seat. She had the support of all the relevant politicos and was considered a sure winner until Kimberly, a local television personality, entered the race. Kimberly and Judith had been friends and Judith felt betrayed by Kimberly's candidacy, believing that Kimberly was using her name recognition to rob Judith of a position she'd been working towards for 15 years. The campaign was consequently a bitter one. Judith doing everything she could to portray Kimberly as an intellectual lightweight who was more concerned about sound bites than issues. And Kimberly painting Judith as an old style politico with plenty of favors owed and sleazy connections to unsavory elements of the power structure.

In an attempt to lower the hostility level, local community leaders organized a charity barbecue one weekend and invited both Judith and Kimberly to be celebrity chefs. The candidates were placed at barbecue grills on a raised dais before the large crowd where they were each supposed to cook a mess of ribs using their own special barbecue sauces. While preparing to cook, Judith was using a large chef's knife to trim the ribs she intended to barbecue. The slab of meat slipped from her grasp and fell to the floor. Judith swung rapidly towards the meat and uttered a sincere damn when she saw she could not save it from the filthy floor. Kimberly turned at the same moment and, seeing Judith crouched, holding a large knife apparently pointed at her, and appearing very angry, Kimberly believed that Judith was trying to kill her. Kimberly grabbed her own chef's knife and plunged it into Judith's neck.

At Kimberly's trial for the murder of Judith, Kimberly should be found guilty of:

A. No crime, because Kimberly was justified in killing Judith, whom she reasonably believed was about to kill her.
B. No crime, because Kimberly was excused in killing Judith, whom she reasonably believed was about to kill her.
C. Voluntary manslaughter, because Kimberly unreasonably but in good faith believed that Judith was about to kill her.
D. Murder, because the bitterness between the candidates demonstrates that Kimberly killed Judith with malice aforethought.

OA156: Conor Lamb & Pennsylvania Recounts

Nine gang members, including the gang leader, were indicted for the murder of a 10th gang member who had become an informant. The gang leader pleaded guilty. At the trial of the other eight gang members, the state's evidence showed the following:

The gang leader had announced a party to celebrate the release of a gang member from jail, but the party was not what it seemed. The gang leader had learned that the released gang member had earned his freedom by informing the authorities about the gang's criminal activities. The gang leader decided to use the party to let other gang members see what happened to informants. He told no one about his plan. At the party, after everyone had consumed large amounts of alcohol, the gang leader announced that the released gang member was an informant and stabbed him with a knife in front of the others. The other eight gang members watched and did nothing, while the released gang member bled slowly to death.

The jury found the eight gang members guilty of murder, and they appealed. Should the appellate court uphold the convictions?

A. No, because the mere presence at the scene of a crime is insufficient to make a person an accomplice.
B. No, because murder is a specific intent crime and there is insufficient evidence to show that the other gang members intended to kill.
C. Yes, because the gang members made no effort to save the released gang member after he had been stabbed.
D. Yes, because voluntary intoxication does not negate criminal responsibility.

A driver returning home from a long work shift at a factory fell asleep at the wheel and lost control of his car. As a result, his car collided with a police car being driven by an officer who was returning to the station after having responded to an emergency. The officer was injured in the accident and later sued the driver in negligence for her injuries. The driver has moved for summary judgment, arguing that the common law firefighters rule bars the suit.

Should the court grant the motion?

A. No, because the firefighters rule does not apply to police officers.
B. No, because the police officer's injuries were not related to any special dangers of her job.
C. Yes, because the accident would not have occurred but for the emergency.
D. Yes, because the police officer was injured on the job.

Question #070.
OA162: Tariffs and Trade

A lumber supplier agreed to sell to a furniture manufacturer all the lumber that the manufacturer required over a two-year period. The sales contract provided that the payment was due 60 days after delivery, but that a 3% discount would be allowed if the manufacturer paid within 10 days of delivery. Now, during the first year of the contract, the manufacturer regularly paid within the 10-day period and received the 3% discount. But 15 days after the supplier had made its most recent lumbered delivery to the manufacturer, the supplier had received no payment from the manufacturer. At the time, The supplier became aware of rumors from a credible source that the manufacturer's financial condition was precarious. The supplier called the manufacturer demanding assurances regarding the manufacturer's financial status. The manufacturer immediately mailed to the supplier its latest audited financial statements, as well as a satisfactory credit report prepared by the manufacturer's banker. The rumors proved to be false. Nevertheless, the supplier refused to resume deliveries. The manufacturer sued the supplier for breach of contract.

Will the manufacturer likely prevail? That's very interesting.

A. No, because the contract was unenforceable since the manufacturer had not committed to purchase a definite quantity of lumber.
B. No, because the supplier had reasonable grounds for insecurity and was therefore entitled to cancel the contract and refuse to make any future deliveries.
C. Yes, because the credit report and auditory statements provided adequate assurance of due performance under the contract.
D. Yes, because the supplier was not entitled to condition resumption of deliveries on the receipt of financial status.

Question #071.
OA164: As American As Baseball, Hush Money, andâ€¦ Segregated Schools?

A toy manufacturer that has its headquarters and sole manufacturing plant in a particular state. It has developed a Martian toy that simulates the exploration of Mars by a remote-controlled vehicle. It accurately depicts the Martian landscape and the unmanned exploratory vehicle traversing it. The toy is of high quality, safe and durable, and has sold very well. Other toy manufacturers, all located outside of the state, have developed similar toys that are lower in price. These manufacturers have contracts to sell their Martian toys to outlets in the state. Although these toys are safe and durable, they depict the Martian landscape less realistically than the toys manufactured in the state. Nevertheless, because of the price difference, sales of these toys, that is the cheap out-of-state knockoffs, have severely cut into the sales of the Martian toys manufactured in the state.

The state legislature has recently enacted a law "to protect the children of the state from faulty science and to protect in-state toy manufacturers from unfair competition". The law forbids the sale in the state of any toy that purports to represent extraterrestrial objects and does not satisfy specified scientific criteria. The Martian toy manufactured in the state satisfies all the criteria. None of the Martian toys of the competing manufacturers meet the requirement.

Is that state law constitutional?

A. No, because it abrogates the obligations of the contracts between the other toy manufacturers and the in-state outlets that have agreed to sell their Martian toys.
B. No, because it imposes an undue burden on interstate commerce.
C. Yes, because it deals with only a local matter, the sale of toys in stores located within the state.
D. Yes, because the state's interest in protecting the state's children from faulty science justifies this burden on interstate commerce.

OA166: The Taint Team (& Also, Alex Jones)

A landowner executed an instrument in the proper form of a deed purporting to convey his land to a friend. The landowner handed the instrument to the friend saying "This is yours, but please do not record it until after I'm dead. Otherwise, it will cause me no end of trouble with my relatives". Two days later, the landowner asked the friend to return the deed to him because he had decided that he should devise the land to the friend by will rather than by deed. The friend said that he would destroy the deed and so a day or so later falsely told the landowner that the deed had been destroyed. Six months ago, the landowner, who had never executed a will, died intestine, survived by a daughter as his sole heir. The day after the landowner's death, the friend recorded the deed from him. As soon as the daughter discovered this recording and the friend's claim to the land, she brought an appropriate action against the friend to quiet title to the land.

For whom should the court hold?

A. The daughter, Because the death of the landowner deprived the subsequent recording of any effect.
B. The daughter because the friend was dishonest in reporting that he had destroyed the deed.
C. The friend because the deed was delivered to him.
D. The friend because the deed was recorded by him.

Question #073.
OA168: Michael Cohen Takes Five

A landlord leased an apartment to a tenant by written lease for two years, ending on the last day of a recent month.

The lease provided for $700 in monthly rent. The tenant occupied the apartment and paid the rent for the first 15 months of the lease term until he moved to another city to take a new job. Without consulting the landlord, the tenant moved a friend into the apartment and signed an informal writing transferring to the friend his "lease rights for the remaining nine months of the lease". The friend made the next four $700 rent payments to the landlord. But for the final five months of the lease term, no rent was paid by anyone, and the friend moved out with three months left on the term. A landlord was on an extended trip abroad and did not learn of the default and the vacancy until the end of the lease term. The landlord has sued the tenant and the friend jointly and severally for $3,500 for the last five months rent.

What is the likely outcome of this lawsuit?

A. Both the tenant and the friend are liable for the full $3,500 because the tenant is liable on privity of contract and the friend is liable on privity of estate as an assignee.
B. The friend is liable for $1,400 on privity of estate, which lasted only until he vacated, and the tenant is liable for $2,100 on privity of contract and estate for the period after the friend vacated.
C. The friend is liable for $3,500 on privity of estate and the tenant is not liable because of the landlord's failure to object to the friend's payment of rent relieved the tenant of liability.
D. The tenant is liable for $3,500 on privity of contract and the friend is not liable because a sublessee does not have personal liability to the original landlord.

Question #074.
OA170: All Yodel, All the Time

In a civil trial arising from a car accident at an intersection, the plaintiff testified on direct examination that he came to a full stop at the intersection. On cross-examination, the defendant's lawyer asked whether the plaintiff claimed to have been exercising due care at the time, which is the standard for negligence, and the plaintiff replied that he had been driving carefully. At a sidebar conference, the defendant's lawyer sought permission to ask the plaintiff about two accidents in the previous 12 months in which he had received traffic citations for failing to stop at stop signs. The plaintiff's lawyer has objected.

Should the court allow defense counsel to ask the plaintiff about his two prior accidents?

A. No, because improperly failing to stop on the other occasions does not bear on plaintiff's veracity and does not contradict his testimony in this case.
B. No, because there is no indication that failing to stop on the other occasions led to convictions.
C. Yes, because improperly failing to stop on the other occasions bears on plaintiff's credibility since he claims to have stopped in this case.
D. Yes, because improperly failing to stop on the recent occasions tends to contradict the plaintiff's claim that he was driving carefully at the time that he collided with the defendant.

Question #075.
OA172: Private Prisons, Judge Ellis & More

A landowner and a contractor entered into a written contract under which the contractor agreed to build a building and pave an adjacent sidewalk for the landowner for $200,000. Later, while construction was proceeding, the landowner and the contractor entered into an oral modification under which the contractor was not obligated to pave the sidewalk, but still would be entitled to the $200,000 upon completion of the building. The contractor completed the building. The landowner, after discussions with his landscaper, demanded that the contractor pave the adjacent sidewalk. The contractor refused.

Has the contractor breached the contract?

A. No, because the oral modification was in good faith and therefore enforceable.
B. Yes, because a discharge of a contractual obligation must be in writing.
C. Yes, because the parole evidence rule bars proof of the oral modification.
D. Yes, because there was no consideration for the discharge of the contractor's duty to pave the sidewalk.

Question #076.
OA174: Is Michael Avenatti Fit To Practice Law In New York?

A defendant was charged with burglary. At trial, a police officer testified that, after the defendant had been arrested and had agreed to answer questions, the officer had interrogated him with a stenographer present, but that the officer could not recall what the defendant had said. The prosecutor presented the officer with a photocopy of the stenographic transcript of the interrogation. After looking at it, the officer began to testify that he recalled that the defendant had admitted to being in the area of the burglary. The defendant has objected to the officer's testimony on the ground that it violates the "original document" rule (also known as the "best evidence" rule).

Should the officer's testimony concerning the defendant's recorded confession be admitted?

A. No, because a photocopy cannot be used without a showing that the original is unavailable.
B. No, because the stenographer has not testified to the accuracy of the transcript.
C. Yes, because a photocopy is a duplicate of the original.
D. Yes, because the prosecutor is not attempting to prove the contents of the document.

Question #077.
OA176: It's Summer (Zervos) Time!

A state legislature passed a statute providing that juries in criminal trials were to consist of 6 jurors, rather than 12, and that jury verdicts did not have to be unanimous but could be based on 5 votes out of 6 jurors.

A defendant was tried for murder. Over his objection, he was tried by a jury composed of 6 jurors. The jurors found him guilty by a vote of 5 to 1, and over the defendant's objection, the court entered a judgment of conviction, which was affirmed on appeal by the stateâ€™s highest court.

The defendant seeks to overturn his conviction in a habeas corpus proceeding in federal court, claiming that the trial court violated his constitutional rights by allowing both a non-unanimous jury verdict and a jury composed of fewer than 12 members.

How is the federal court likely to rule in this action?

A. It will set aside the conviction, because the jury was composed of fewer than 12 members.
B. It will set aside the conviction, because the 6-person jury verdict was not unanimous.
C. It will set aside the conviction, both because the jury was composed of fewer than 12 members and because the 6-person jury verdict was not unanimous.
D. It will uphold the conviction.

Question #078.
OA178: Trump and the NFL

In a civil trial for professional malpractice, the plaintiff sought to show that the defendant, an engineer, had designed the plaintiff's flour mill with inadequate power. The plaintiff called an expert witness who based his testimony solely on his own professional experience but also asserted, when asked, that the book *Smith on Milling Systems* was a reliable treatise in the field and consistent with his views. On cross-examination, the defendant asked the witness whether he and Smith were ever wrong. The witness answered, "Nobody's perfect." The defendant asked no further questions. The defendant later called his own expert witness and asked, "Do you accept the Smith book as reliable?" The witness said, "It once was, but it is now badly out of date." The plaintiff requested that the jury be allowed to examine the book and judge for itself the book's reliability.

Should the court allow the jury to examine the book?

A. No, because the jury may consider only passages read to it by counsel or by a witness.
B. No, because the plaintiff's expert did not rely on the treatise in his testimony but on his own experience.
C. Yes, because an expert has testified that the treatise is reliable.
D. Yes, because the jury is the judge of the weight and credibility to be accorded both written and oral evidence.

Question #079.
OA180: Masterpiece Cakeshop

A grantor executed an instrument in the proper form of a warranty deed purporting to convey attractive land to his church. The granting clause of the instrument ran to the church, "and its successors forever, so long as the premises are used for church purposes". The church took possession of the land and used it as a site of worship for many years. Subsequently, the church decided to relocate and entered into a valid written contract to sell the land to a buyer for a substantial price. The buyer wanted to use the land as a site for business activities and objected to the church's title.

The contract contained no provision relating to the quality of the title the church was bound to convey. There is no applicable statute. When the buyer refused to close, the church sued the buyer for specific performance and properly joined the grand tour as a party. Is the church likely to prevail?

A. No, because the grantor's interest prevents the church's title from being marketable.
B. No, because the quoted provision is a valid restrictive covenant.
C. Yes, because a charitable trust to support religion will attach to the proceeds of the sale.
D. Yes, because the grantor cannot derogate from his warranty.

Question #080.
OA182: Paul Manafort is Going to Prison

A car owner washed her car while it was parked on a public street, in violation of a local ordinance that prohibits the washing of vehicles on public streets during specified hours. The statute was enacted only to expedite the flow of automobile traffic. Due to sudden and unexpected cold weather, the car ownerâ€™s waste water formed a puddle that froze in a crosswalk. A Pedestrian slipped on the frozen puddle and broke her leg. The pedestrian sued the car owner to recover for her injury. At trial, the only evidence the pedestrian offered as to negligence was the car owner's admission that she had violated the ordinance. At the conclusion of the evidence, both parties moved for a directed verdict.

How should the trial judge proceed?

A. Deny both motions and submit the case to the jury, because, on the facts, the jury may infer that the car owner was negligent.
B. Deny both motions and submit the case to the jury, because the jury may consider the ordinance violation as evidence that the car owner was negligent.
C. Grant the car owner's motion, because the pedestrian has failed to offer adequate evidence that the car owner was negligent.
D. Grant the pedestrianâ€™s motion, because of the car ownerâ€™s admitted ordinance violation.

Question #081.
OA184: Families at the Border

A state university adopted a new regulation prohibiting certain kinds of speech on campus. Students, staff, and faculty convicted by campus tribunals of violating the regulation were subject to penalties that included fines, suspensions, expulsions, and termination of employment. The regulation was widely unpopular, and there was a great deal of public anger directed toward the two tenured professors who had drafted and promoted it. The following year, the state legislature approved a severable provision in the appropriations bill for the university declaring that none of the university's funding could be used to pay the two professors, who were specifically named in the provision. In the past, the professor's salaries had always been paid from funds appropriated to the university by the legislature, and the university had no other funds that could be used to pay them.

If the professors challenge the constitutionality of the appropriations provision, is the court likely to uphold the provision?

A. No, because it amounts to the imposition by the legislature of a punishment without trial.
B. No, because it is based on conduct the professors engaged in before it was enacted.
C. Yes, because the Eleventh Amendment gives the state legislature plenary power to appropriate state funds in the manner that it deems most conducive to the welfare of its people.
D. Yes, because the full faith and credit clause requires the court to enforce the provision strictly according to its terms.

Question #082.
OA187: Lowering the Lukumi Bar?

Police officers received a tip that illegal drugs were being sold at a certain ground-floor apartment. They decided to stake out the apartment. The stakeout revealed that a significant number of people visited the apartment for short periods of time and then left. A man exited the apartment and started to walk briskly away. The officers grabbed the man and, when he struggled, wrestled him to the ground. They searched him and found a bag of heroin in one of his pockets. After discovering the heroin on the man, the officers decided to enter the apartment. They knocked on the door, which was opened by the woman who lived there. The officers asked if they could come inside, and the woman gave them permission to do so. Once inside, the officers observed several bags of heroin on the living room table.

The woman has been charged with possession of the heroin found on the living room table. She has filed a pretrial motion to suppress the heroin on the ground that it was obtained by an illegal search and seizure.

A. No, because the tip together with the heroin found in the manâ€™s pocket provided probable cause for the search.
B. No, because the woman consented to the officersâ€™ entry.
C. Yes, because the officersâ€™ decision to enter the apartment was the fruit of an illegal search of the man.
D. Yes, because the officers did not inform the woman that she could refuse consent.

OA195: Lordy, There Are Tapes!

During negotiations to purchase a used car, a buyer asked a dealer whether the car had ever been in an accident. The dealer replied: "It is a fine car and has been thoroughly inspected and comes with a certificate of assured quality. Feel free to have the car inspected by your own mechanic."

OA197: Undetectable, Untraceable, 3-D Printed Guns

A state constitution provides that in every criminal trial "the accused shall have the right to confront all witnesses against him face to face." A defendant was convicted in state court of child abuse based on testimony from a six-year-old child. The child testified while she was seated behind one-way glass, which allowed the defendant to see the child but did not allow the child to see the defendant. The defendant appealed to the stateâ€™s highest court, claiming that the inability of the child to see the defendant while she testified violated both the United States Constitution and the state constitution. Without addressing the federal constitutional issue, the stateâ€™s highest court reversed the defendant's conviction and ordered a new trial. The court held that "the constitution of this state is clear, and it requires that while testifying in a criminal trial, witness must be able to see the defendant." The state petitioned the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari

On which ground should the United States Supreme Court DENY the state's petition?

A. A state may not seek appellate review in the United States Supreme Court of the reversal of a criminal conviction by its highest court.
B. The decision of the stateâ€™s highest court was based on an adequate and independent state ground.
C. The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution does not require that a witness against a criminal defendant be able to see the defendant while the witness testifies.
D. The decision of the stateâ€™s highest court requires a new trial, and therefore it is not a final judgment.

Question #088.
OA199: Asbestos??!? (Or: Why Is This Man Smiling?)

On January 5, a creditor loaned $1,000 to a debtor under a contract calling for the debtor to repay the loan at the rate of $100 per month payable on the first day of each month. On February 1, at the debtor's request, the creditor agreed to permit payment on February 5. On March 1, the debtor requested a similar time extension and the creditor replied, "Donâ€™t bother me each month. Just change the date of payment to the fifth of the month. But you must now make the payments by cashier's check." The debtor said, "Okay," and made payments on March 5 and April 5 by cashier's check. On April 6, the creditor sold the loan contract to a bank but did not tell the bank about the agreement permitting payments on the fifth of the month. On April 6, the bank wrote to the debtor: "Your debt to [the creditor] has been assigned to us. We hereby inform you that all payments must be made on the first day of the month."

Can the debtor justifiably insist that the payment date for the rest of the installments is the fifth of each month?

A. No, because a contract modification is not binding on an assignee who had no knowledge of the modification.
B. No, because although the creditor waived the condition of payment on the first of the month, the bank reinstated it.
C. Yes, because although the creditor waived the condition of payment on the first of the month, the creditor could not assign to the bank his right to reinstate that condition.
D. Yes, because the creditor could assign to the bank only those rights the creditor had in the contract at the time of the assignment.

Question #089.
A buyer entered into a written contract to purchase from a seller 1,000 sets of specially manufactured ball bearings of a nonstandard dimension for a price of $10 per set.

Fifty-five days later, after the seller had completed production of the 1,000 sets, the buyer abandoned the project that required the specially manufactured ball bearings and repudiated the contract with the seller. After notifying the buyer of his intention to resell, the seller sold the 1,000 sets of ball bearings to a salvage company for $2 per set. The seller then sued the buyer for damages.

What damages should the court award to the seller?

A. $2 per set, representing the difference between the cost of manufacture and the price the buyer agreed to pay.
B. $6 per set, representing the difference between the cost of manufacture and the salvage price.
C. $8 per set, representing the lost profits plus the unrecovered cost of manufacture.

Question #090.
OA203: Paul Manafort Convicted, Michael Cohen Pleads

A construction company was digging a trench for a new sewer line in a street in a high-crime neighborhood. During the course of the construction, there had been many thefts of tools and equipment from the construction area. One night, the construction companyâ€™s employees neglected to place warning lights around the trench. A delivery truck drove into the trench and broke an axle. While the truck driver was looking for a telephone to call a tow truck, thieves broke into the truck and stole $350,000 worth of goods. The delivery company sued the construction company to recover for the $350,000 loss and for the damage to its truck. The construction company has stipulated that it was negligent in failing to place warning lights around the trench and admits liability for damage to the truck, but it denies liability for the loss of the goods.

On cross-motions for summary judgment on the claim for the goods, how should the court rule?

A. Deny both motions, because there is evidence to support a finding that the construction company should have realized that its negligence could create an opportunity for a third party to commit a crime.
B. Grant the construction companyâ€™s motion, because no one could have foreseen that the failure to place warning lights could result in the loss of a cargo of valuable goods.
C. Grant the construction companyâ€™s motion, because the criminal acts of third persons were a superseding cause of the loss.
D. Grant the delivery companyâ€™s motion, because but for the construction companyâ€™s actions, the goods would not have been stolen.

The defendant has moved to dismiss the indictment on double jeopardy grounds.

Should the motion be granted?

A. No, because jeopardy had not attached before either grand jury was impaneled.
B. No, because there has been no conviction or acquittal.
C. Yes, because any proceeding after the preliminary hearing would violate double jeopardy.
D. Yes, because bringing the case before the second grand jury violated the double jeopardy clause.

OA211: Manafort Flips (and more on Kavanaugh)

Congress passed a statute directing the United States Forest Service, a federal agency, to issue regulations to control campfires on federal public lands and to establish a schedule of penalties for those who violate the new regulations. The statute provides that the Forest Service regulations should "reduce, to the maximum extent feasible, all potential hazards that arise from campfires on Forest Service lands." The Forest Service issued the regulations and the schedule of penalties directed by Congress.

Which of the following arguments best supports a finding that the rule providing for the fines is constitutional?

A. The executive branch of government, of which the Forest Service is part, has inherent rule-making authority over public lands.
B. The rule was issued pursuant to a valid exercise of Congress's power to delegate rule-making authority to federal agencies.
C. The rule is justified by a compelling government interest in safeguarding forest resources,
D. The rule relates directly to law enforcement, which is an executive rather than a legislative function, and hence it does not need specific congressional authorization.

A bakery offered a chef a permanent full-time job as a pastry chef at a salary of $3,000 per month. The chef agreed to take the position and to begin work in two weeks. In her employment application, the chef had indicated that she was seeking Permanent job. One week after the chef was hired by the bakery, a hotel offered the chef a position as a restaurant manager at a salary of $3,500 a month. The chef accepted and promptly notified the bakery that she would not report for work at the bakery.

Is the bakery likely to prevail in a lawsuit against the chef for breach of contract?

A. No, because a contract for permanent employment would be interpreted to mean that the chef could leave at any time,
B. No, because the position the chef took with the hotel was not substantially comparable to the one she had agreed to take with the bakery.
C. Yes, because the chef's acceptance of a permanent position meant that she agreed to leave the bakery only after a reasonable time.
D. Yes, because the chef's failure to give the bakery a chance to match the salary offered by the hotel breached the implied right of first refusal.

OA219: Harvard and Affirmative Action

A city zoning ordinance requires that anyone who proposes to operate a group home obtain a special use permit from the city zoning board. The zoning ordinance defines a group home as a residence in which four or more unrelated adults reside. An individual applied for a special use permit to operate a group home for convicts during their transition from serving prison sentences to their release on parole. Although the proposed group home met all of the requirements for the special use permit, the zoning board denied the individual's application because of the nature of the proposed use. The individual sued the zoning board seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on constitutional grounds.

Which of the following best states the appropriate burden of persuasion in this action?

A. Because housing is a fundamental right, the zoning board must demonstrate that denial of the permit is necessary to serve a compelling state interest.
B. Because the zoning boardâ€™s action has the effect of discriminating against a quasi-suspect class in regard to a basic subsistence right, the zoning board must demonstrate that the denial of the permit is substantially related to an important state interest.
C. Because the zoning boardâ€™s action invidiously discriminates against a suspect class, the zoning board must demonstrate that denial of the permit is necessary to serve a compelling state interest
D. Because the zoning board's action is in the nature of an economic or social welfare regulation, the individual seeking the permit must demonstrate that the denial of the permit is not rationally related to a legitimate state interest.

OA221: Elections Have Consequences, Florida Edition

State troopers lawfully stopped a car driver on a turnpike for exceeding the speed limit by four miles per hour. One trooper approached the car to warn the driver to drive within the speed limit. The other trooper remained in the patrol car and ran a computer check of the car's license number. The computer check indicated that there was an outstanding warrant for the driver's arrest for unpaid traffic tickets. The troopers then arrested the driver based on the warrant, and they proceeded to search the driver. During the search, they discovered a package of heroin in one of the driver's pockets. Later, it was learned that the driver had paid the outstanding traffic tickets 10 days earlier and that the warrant had been quashed, but the clerk of the court had filed to update the computer, which continued to list the warrant as outstanding.

The driver was charged with unlawful possession of heroin. Her attorney has filed a motion to suppress the use of the heroin as evidence

A. No, because the troopers could reasonably rely on the computer report and the search was incident to arrest.
B. No, because troopers may lawfully search a driver incident to a valid traffic stop.
C. Yes, because there was no arrest for the traffic violation and no lawful arrest could be made on the basis of the warrant.
D. Yes, because there was no probable cause or reasonable suspicion to believe that the driver possessed drugs,

OA223: A Victory for Voting Rights in Pennsylvania!

An investor purchased a tract of commercial land, financing a large part of the purchase price with a loan from a business partner that was secured by a mortgage. The investor made the installment payments on the mortgage regularly for several years. Then the investor persuaded a neighbor to buy the land, subject to the mortgage to his partner. They expressly agreed that the neighbor would not assume and agree to pay the investor's debt to the partner. The investor's mortgage to the partner contained a due-on-sale clause stating, "If Mortgagor transfers his or her interest without the written consent of Mortgagee first obtained, then at Mortgageeâ€™s option the entire principal balance of the debt secured by this Mortgage shall become immediately due and payable." However, without seeking his partner's consent, the investor conveyed the land to the neighbor, the deed stating that it was "subject to a mortgage to [the partner]" and giving details and recording data related to the mortgage. The neighbor took possession of the land and made several mortgage payments, which the partner accepted. Now, however, neither the neighbor nor the investor has made the last three mortgage payments. The partner has sued the neighbor for the amount of the delinquent payments.

In this action, for whom should the court render judgment?

A. The neighbor, because she did not assume and agree to pay the investor's mortgage debt.
B. The neighbor, because she is not in privity of estate with the partner.
C. The partner, because the investor's deed to the neighbor violated the due-on-sale clause.
D. The partner, because the neighbor is in privity of estate with the partner.

OA231: The End of the Beginning (for Trump)

A purchaser bought land in the mountain foothills just outside a resort town and planned to build a housing development there. Soon thereafter, the county in which the land was located unexpectedly adopted a regulation that, for the first time, prohibited all construction in several foothill and mountain areas, including the area of the purchaser's property. The purpose of the county's regulation was "to conserve for future generations the unique natural wildlife and plant habitats" in the mountain areas. Since the adoption of the regulation, the purchaser has been unable to lease or sell the property at any price. Several Realtors have advised the purchaser that the property is now worthless. The purchaser has sued the county, claiming that the regulation has effected a taking of the purchaserâ€™s property and that the county therefore owes the purchaser just compensation.

Is the court likely to rule in favor of the purchaser?

A. No, because the county did not take title to the property from the purchaser.
B. No, because the regulation has not caused or authorized any uninvited physical invasion or intrusion onto the property.
C. Yes, because the conservation objective of the county ordinance is not sufficiently compelling to justify the substantial diminution in the property value.
D. Yes, because the effect of the countyâ€™s regulation is to deny the purchaser's investment-backed expectation and essentially all economically beneficial use of the property.

OA233: [REDACTED] & Wisconsin

A woman who is a computer expert decided to dedicate herself to exposing persons who trafficked in child pornography. She posted a number of sexually oriented photographs on her website. The file for each photograph contained an embedded Trojan horse program (a program that would allow the woman to enter the computer of anyone who downloaded the photograph). A man downloaded one of those photographs onto his personal computer. Using the embedded program, the woman entered the man's computer and found a file containing a pornographic photograph of a child. She copied the file and turned it over to a federal law enforcement agency. A federal agent told her that a successful prosecution would require more than one photograph and offered her a monetary reward for additional photographs leading to the manâ€™s conviction. The woman entered the manâ€™s computer again, and this time she found hundreds of child pornography photographs, which she turned over to the federal agency.

The man was charged with multiple counts of violating federal child pornography statutes. He has moved to suppress the photographs that the woman discovered on his computer. The motion is based on both the Fourth Amendment and a federal statute forbidding interception of electronic communication without permission. The parties have stipulated that the woman's conduct in downloading photographs from the manâ€™s computer violated the interception statute.

How should the court rule on the defendantâ€™s motion to suppress?

A. Deny the motion as to all photographs.
B. Grant the motion as to all photographs, because the woman acted without probable cause.
C. Grant the motion as to all photographs, because the woman violated the federal interception statute.
D. Grant the motion only as to the second set of photographs.

The bank agreed to that arrangement, and the dealer then asked the buyer to make his car payments directly to the bank. When the buyer tendered the first payment to the bank, the bank refused the payment, asserting that it would accept payment only from the dealer.

C. "If you find that the defendant obtained the substance in Kansas City and delivered it to Chicago, then you may, but you are not required to, find that the transaction was interstate in nature."
D. "I instruct you that there is a presumption that the substance was sold in an interstate transaction, but the burden of persuasion on that issue is still on the government."

OA239: The Fourth Circuit's Puzzling Emoluments Ruling

An associate professor in the pediatrics department of a local medical school was denied tenure. He asked a national education lobbying organization to represent him in his efforts to have the tenure decision reversed. In response to a letter from the organization on the professor's behalf, the dean of the medical school wrote to the organization explaining truthfully that the professor had been denied tenure because of reports that he had abused two of his former patients. Several months later, after a thorough investigation, the allegations were proven false, and the professor was granted tenure. He had remained working at the medical school at full pay during the tenure decision review process and thus suffered no pecuniary harm.

In a suit for libel by the professor against the dean of the medical school, will the professor be likely to prevail?

A. No, because the professor invited the libel.
B. No, because the professor suffered no pecuniary loss.
C. Yes, because the dean had a duty to investigate the rumor before repeating it.
D. Yes, because the deanâ€™s defamatory statement was in the form of a writing.

The man showed the car at an antique car show in State B.A woman recognized the car as having been stolen from her. Under State B law, a person whose property is stolen may reclaim it, even if the current possessor is an innocent purchaser. The woman sued the man in a State B court to reclaim the car, In his defense, the man claimed that he had good title under the law of State A. Nevertheless, the State B court applied State B law, and the woman prevailed. The man did not appeal. The sheriff had the car returned to State B and gave the woman possession of the car. Several months later, the woman moved to State A, bringing the car with her. The man brought a new suit against the woman in a State A court, claiming that the State B court in the prior suit should have applied the State A law, which protects innocent purchasers. The woman appeared and moved to dismiss the suit.

What should the State A court do?

A. Apply the federal law of sale of goods, because the car has moved in interstate commerce.
B. Apply State A law, because the car is currently located in State A.
C. Dismiss the suit, because the State A court must give full faith and credit to the State B judgment.
D. Remove the case to federal court, because the car has moved in interstate commerce, and therefore the case raises a federal question.

Question #113.
OA251: Gerrymandering in Maryland Heads Back to SCOTUS

A state statute requires, without exception, that a woman under the age of 18 notify one of her parents at least 48 hours before having an abortion. A proper lawsuit has challenged the constitutionality of this state statute.

In that suit, should the court uphold the constitutionality of the statute?

A. No, because a 48-hour waiting period is excessively long, and therefore the statute imposes an undue burden on a womanâ€™s right to procure an abortion.
B. No, because the state law does not provide a bypass procedure that would allow a court to authorize a minor to obtain an abortion without prior parental notification under appropriate circumstances.
C. Yes, because parents' rights to supervise their minor daughter's health care outweigh any individual right the daughter may have.
D. Yes, because such parental notification and waiting-period requirements do not impose an undue burden on a minor's right to procure an abortion.

Question #114.
OA253: Religious Freedom and Domineque Ray

A businessman owned a hotel, subject to a mortgage securing a debt he owed to a bank. The businessman later acquired a nearby parking garage, financing a part of the purchase price with a loan from a financing company, secured by a mortgage on the parking garage. Two years thereafter, the businessman defaulted on the loan owed to the bank, which caused the full amount of that loan to become immediately due and payable. The bank decided not to foreclose the mortgage on the hotel at that time, but instead properly sued for the full amount of the defaulted loan. The bank obtained and properly filed a judgment for that amount. A statute of the jurisdiction provides: "Any judgment properly filed shall, for 10 years from filing, be a lien on the real property then owned or subsequently acquired by any person against whom the judgment is rendered." There is no other applicable statute, except the statute providing for judicial foreclosure of mortgages, which places no restrictions on deficiency judgments. Shortly thereafter, the bank brought an appropriate action for judicial foreclosure of mortgage on the hotel and of its judgment lien on the parking garage.

The financing company was joined as a party defendant, and appropriately sued for foreclosure of its mortgage on the parking garage, which was also in default. All procedures were properly followed, and the confirmed foreclosure sales resulted in the following: The net proceeds of the sale of the hotel to a third party were $200,000 less than the bank's mortgage balance. The net proceeds of the sale of the parking garage to a fourth party were $200,000 more than the financing companyâ€™s mortgage balance.

How should the $200,000 surplus arising from the sale of the parking garage be distributed?

A. It should be paid to the bank.
B. It should be paid to the businessman.
C. It should be paid to the financing company.
D. It should be split equally between the bank and the financing company.

Question #115.
OA255: Wall of Emergency

In a personal injury case, the plaintiff sued a retail store for injuries she sustained form a fall in the store. The plaintiff alleged that the store had negligently allowed its entryway to become slippery from snow tracked in from the sidewalk. Before the lawsuit was filed, when the plaintiff first threatened to sue, the store's manager said, "I know that there was slush on the marble entryway, but I think your four-inch-high heels were the real cause of your fall. So let's agree that we'll pay your medical bills, and you release us from any claims you might have." The plaintiff refused the offer. At trial, the plaintiff seeks to testify to the manager's statement that "there was slush on that marble entryway."

Is the statement about the slush in the entryway admissible?

A. No, because it is a statement made in the course of compromise negotiations.
B. No, because the manager denied that the slippery condition was the cause of the plaintiff's fall.
C. Yes, as a statement by an agent about a matter within the scope of his authority.
D. Yes, because the rule excluding offers of compromise does not protect statements of fact made during compromise negotiations.

Question #116.
OA257.5 Michael Cohen Testifies, Part 2

In a civil action, a plaintiff sued a decedent's estate to recover damages for injuries she suffered in a collision between her car and one driven by the defendant. At trial, the plaintiff introduced undisputed evidence that the defendant's car had swerved across the centerline of the highway into oncoming traffic, where it had collided with the plaintiff's car. The defendant's estate introduced undisputed evidence that, before he swerved across the centerline, the defendant had suffered fatal heart attack, which he had no reason to foresee, and that, just prior to the heart attack, the defendant had been driving at a reasonable speed and in a reasonable manner. A statute makes it a traffic offense to cross the median of a highway.

In this case, which party is likely to prevail?

A. The defendant's estate, because its rebuttal evidence is undisputed,
B. The defendant's estate, because the plaintiff has not established a prima facie case of liability.
C. The plaintiff, because the accident was of a type that does not ordinarily happen in the absence of negligence on the actor's part.
D. The plaintiff, because the decedent crossed the median in violation of the statute,

Question #117.
OA259: Your Guide to the Congressional Investigations

A group of students at a state university's law school wished to debate the future of affirmative action in that state and at that law school. For this debate, they requested the use of a meeting room in the law school that is available on a first-come, first-served basis for extracurricular student use. Speakers presenting all sides of the issue were scheduled to participate. The law school administration denied the use of its meeting room for this purpose solely because it believed that "such debate, even if balanced, would have a negative effect on the morale of the law school community and might cause friction among the students that would disrupt the institution's educational mission."

Is the law schoolâ€™s denial of the use of its meeting room for this purpose constitutional?

A. No, because the law school cannot demonstrate that is action was necessary to serve a compelling state interest.
B. No, because the law school cannot demonstrate that its action was rationally related to a legitimate state interest.
C. Yes, because the law schoolâ€™s only concern was the adverse effect of such a discussion of affirmative action on the immediate audience and the mission of the institution.
D. Yes, because the law students do not have a right to use a state-owned law school facility for a meeting that is not organized and sponsored by the law school itself.

Question #118.
OA261: Sentencing Paul Manafort

A landowner lawfully subdivided his land into 10 large lots. The recorded subdivision plan imposed no restrictions on any of the 10 lots. Within two months after recording the plan, the landowner conveyed Lot 1 to a buyer, by a deed that contained no restrictions on the lot's use. There was then a lull in sales. Two years later, the real estate market in the state had generally improved, and during the next six months, the landowner sold and conveyed eight of the remaining nine lots. In each of the eight deeds of conveyance, the landowner included the following language: "It is a term and condition of this conveyance, which shall be covenant running with the land for the benefit of each of the 10 lots [with an appropriate reference to the recorded subdivision plan] that for 15 years from the date of recording of the plan, no use shall be made of the premises herein conveyed except for single-family residential purposes." The buyer of Lot 1 had actual knowledge of what the landowner had done. The landowner included the quoted language in part because the municipality had amended its zoning ordinance a year earlier to permit professional offices in any residential zone. Shortly after the landowner's most recent sale, when he owned only one unsold lot, the buyer of Lot 1 constructed a one-story house on Lot 1 and then conveyed Lot 1 to 8 doctor. The deed to the doctor contained no reference to any restriction on the use of Lot 1. The doctor applied for an appropriate certificate of occupancy to enable her to use a pat of the house on Lot 1 as a medical office. The landowner, on behalf of himself a the owner of the unsold lot, and on behalf of the other lot owners, sued to enjoin the doctor from carrying out her plans and to impose the quoted restriction on Lot 1.

Who is likely to prevail?

A. The doctor, because Lot 1 was conveyed without the restrictive covenant in the deed to the first buyer and the subsequent deed to the doctor.
B. The doctor, because zoning ordinances override private restrictive covenants as a matter of public policy.
C. The landowner, because the doctor, as a successor in interest to the first buyer, is estopped from denying that Lot 1 remains subject to the zoning ordinance as it existed when the landowner conveyed Lot 1 to the first buyer.
D. The landowner, because with the first buyer's knowledge of the facts, Lot 1 became incorporated into a common scheme.

Question #119.
OA263: Nielsen v. Preap and Due Process Due Aliens

A seller and a buyer have dealt with each other in hundreds of separate grain contracts over the last five years. In performing each contract, the seller delivered the grain to the buyer and, upon delivery, the buyer signed ice that showed an agreed-upon price for that delivery. Each invoice was silent in regard to any discount from the price for prompt payment. The custom of the grain trade is to allow a 2% discount from the invoice price for payment within 10 days of delivery. In all of their prior transactions and without objection from the seller the buyer took 15 days to pay and deducted 5% from the invoice price.

The seller and the buyer recently entered into a contract for a single delivery of wheat at a price of $300,000. The same delivery procedure and invoice were used for this contract as had been used previously. The seller delivered the wheat and the buyer then signed the invoice. On the third day after delivery, the buyer received the following note from the seller: "Payment in full in accordance with signed invoice is due immediately. No discounts permitted. s/Seller."

Which of the following statements concerning these facts is most accurate?

A. The custom of the trade controls, and the buyer is entitled to take a 2% discount if he pays within 10 days.
B. The parties' course of dealing controls, and the buyer is entitled to take a 5% discount if he pays within 15 days
C. The seller's retraction of his prior waiver controls, and the buyer is entitled to no discount.
D. The written contract controls, and the buyer is entitled to no discount because of the parole evidence rule.

Question #120.
OA265: The Investigation is Over, But the Investigations Continue (feat. Randall Eliason)

A bus passenger was seated next to a woman whom he did not know. The woman stood to exit the bus, leaving a package on the seat. The passenger lightly tapped the woman on the back to get her attention and to inform her that she had forgotten the package. Because the woman had recently had back surgery, the tap was painful and caused her to twist and seriously injure her back.

If the woman sues the passenger to recover for the back injury, will she be likely to prevail?

A. No, because she is presumed to have consented to the ordinary contacts of daily life.
B. No, because she was not put in apprehension by the touching.
C. Yes, because the passenger intentionally touched her.
D. Yes, because the passenger's intentional touching seriously injured her.

Question #121.

B. Section 2 is constitutional, but Section 1 is not.
C. Sections 1 and 2 are constitutional.
D. Sections 1 and 2 are unconstitutional.

Question #122.
OA269: JULIAN ASSANGE ARRESTED

In a civil action for misrepresentation in the sale of real estate, the parties contested whether the defendant was licensed by the State Board of Realtors, a public agency established by statue to license real estate brokers. The defendant testified that she was licensed. On rebuttal, the plaintiff has offered a certification, bearing the seal of the secretary of the State Board of Realtors. The certification states that the secretary conducted a thorough search of the agency's records and all relevant databases, and that this search uncovered no record of license ever having been issued to the defendant. The certification is signed by the secretary.

Is the certification that there is no record of a license having been issued to the defendant admissible?

A. No, because it is hearsay not within any exception.
B. No, because the writing was not property authenticated.
C. Yes, for the limited purpose of impeaching the defendant.
D. Yes, to prove the nonexistence of a public record.

Question #123.
OA273: Sears, Steve Mnuchin & "The Producers"

A seller entered into written contract to sell a tract of land to an investor. The contract made no mention of the quality of title to be conveyed. The seller and the investor later completed the sale, and the seller delivered a warranty deed to the investor. Soon thereafter, the value of the land increased dramatically. The investor entered into a written contract to sell the land to a buyer. The contract between the investor and the buyer expressly provided that the investor would convey a marketable title. The buyer's attorney discovered that the tile of the land was not marketable and had not been marketable when the original seller had conveyed to the investor. The buyer refused to complete the sale. The investor sued the original seller for breach of contact, claiming damages from the seller's failure to convey marketable title, which resulted in the investor's loss of the sale to the subsequent buyer.

Who is likely to prevail on this count?

A. The investor, because the law implies in such a contract a covenant that the title will be marketable.
B. The investor, because the original seller is liable for all reasonably foreseeable damages.
C. The original seller, because her contract obligations as to title merged into the deed.
D. The original seller, because she did not expressly agree to convey marketable title.

Question #124.
OA275: Yes, Bill Barr Perjured Himself

A consumer became physically ill after drinking part of a bottle of soda that contained a large decomposed snail. The consumer sued the store from which she had bought the soda to recover damages for her injuries. The parties agreed that the snail had been put into the bottle during the bottling process, over which the store had no control. The parties also agreed that the snail would have been visible in the bottle before the consumer opened it.

Will the consumer be likely to prevail in an action against the store?

A. No, because the consumer could have seen the snail in the bottle before she drank out of it.
B. No, because the store was not responsible for the bottling process.
C. Yes, because the consumer was injured by a defective product sold to her by the store.
D. Yes, because the store had exclusive control over the bottle before selling it to the consumer.

OA287: Down the Hatch (Act)?

The childhood home of a former U.S. president is part of a national park located in a city. The National Park Service entered into a contract with an independent antique collector to acquire items owned by residents of the city during the former residents' lifetime. According to the contract, the collector purchases items and then sells them to the Park Service at a price equal to the collector's cost plus a 10% commission. Purchases by antique collectors are ordinarily subject to the sales tax of the state in which the city is located. The collector has filed suit in state court to enjoin collection of the tax on these purchases for the Park Service, claiming that the sales tax is unconstitutional as applied to them.

Should the state court issue the injunction?

A. No, because as the purchaser of the antiques, the collector, rather than the federal government, is liable for the tax.
B. No, because the suit is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts.
C. Yes, because the federal government is contractually obligated to pay the amount of the sales tax when the government covers the collector's cost of the antiques.
D. Yes, because under the supremacy clause, the federal program to acquire the antiques preempts the state sales tax on the purchase of these items.

OA289: #OpposeJustinWalker

The defendant, a young doctor, was charged with falsely claiming deductions on her federal income tax return. At trial, a witness testified for the defendant that she has a reputation in the community for complete honesty. After a sidebar conference at which the prosecutor gave the judge a record showing that the defendant's medical school had disciplined her for altering her transcript, the prosecutor proposed to ask the witness on cross-examination: "Have you ever heard that the defendant falsified her medical school transcript?"

Is the prosecutor's question proper?

A. No, because it calls for hearsay not within any exception.
B. No, because its minimal relevance on the issue of income tax fraud is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.
C. Yes, because an affirmative answer will be probative of the defendant's character trait for dishonesty and, therefore, her guilt.
D. Yes, because an affirmative answer will impeach the witness's credibility.

Question #132.
OA292: The End of Democracy

B. No, because the worker should have anticipated an injury during his volunteer work.
C. Yes, because the homeowner did not take adequate precautions to secure the snake.
D. Yes, because the worker's injury was the result of his fear of the escaped snake.

Question #133.
OA294: How To Fix The Supreme Court!

A buyer validly contracted in writing to buy improved land from a seller. The contract had no contingencies and was silent as to risk of loss if there was damage to, or destruction of, property improvements between contract and closing, and as to any duty to carry insurance. As soon as the parties signed the contract, the seller (who had already moved out) canceled her insurance covering the land. The buyer did not know this and did not obtain insurance. A few days later, three weeks before the agreed closing date the building on the land was struck by lightning and burned to the ground. There is no applicable statute. In an appropriate action, the buyer asserted the right to cancel the contract and to recover his earnest money. The seller said that because the risk of fire loss had passed to the buyer before the fire, the buyer must perform.

If the seller prevails, what will be the most likely explanation?

A. Once the parties signed the contract, only the buyer had an insurable interest and so could have protected against this loss.
B. The buyer's constructive possession arising from the contract gave him the affirmative duty of protecting against loss by fire.
C. The seller's cancellation of her casualty insurance caused the risk of loss to transfer to the buyer.
D. Upon execution of the contract, the buyer became the equitable owner of the land under the doctrine of equitable conversion.

The clerk agreed, saying, "I know I can trust someone like you with the merchandise." The customer walked out of the store wearing the watch and did not return. A week later, the clerk was at a gathering when she spotted the customer wearing the watch. She told him that he must ether pay for the watch or give it back. He hissed, "You'll be sorry if you mess with me." Intimidated, the clerk backed off.

B. Whether the evidence has any tendency to make the fact of contract formation more or less probable than without the evidence.
C. Whether the evidence is sufficient to prove, absent contrary evidence, that the contract was or was not formed.
D. Whether the evidence makes it more likely than not that a contract was or was not formed.

Question #136.
OA300: Mueller Testifies!

A mother whose adult son was a law school graduate contracted with a tutor to give the son a bar exam preparation course. "If my son passes the bar exam," the mother explained to the tutor, "he has been promised a job with a law firm that will pay $55,000 a year." The tutor agreed to do the work for $5,000, although the going rate was $6,000. Before the instruction was to begin and before any payment was made, the tutor repudiated the contract. Although the mother or the son reasonably could have employed, for $6,000, an equally qualified instructor to replace the tutor, neither did so. The son failed the bar exam, and the law firm refused to employ him. It can be shown that had the son received the tutorâ€™s instruction, he would have passed the bar exam.

If the mother and the son join as plaintiffs and sue the tutor for breach of contract, how much, if anything, are they entitled to recover?

A. $1,000, because all other damages could have been avoided by employing another equally qualified instructor.
B. $55,000, because damages of that amount were within the contemplation of the parties at the time they contracted.
C. Nominal damages only, because the mother was not injured by the breach and the tutor made no promise to the son.
D. Nothing, because neither the mother nor the son took steps to avoid the consequences of the tutor's breach.

Question #137.
OA302: #DemocracyRIP

A federal statute requires the National Bureau of Standards to establish minimum quality standards for all beer sold in the
United States. The statute also provides that public hearings must precede adoption of the standards, and that once they are
adopted, the standards will be subject to judicial review. While the proposed standards have not yet been announced,
several Bureau officials have publicly expressed opinions indicating a belief that pasteurized beer is safer than unpasteurized beer. However, these officials have not stated whether they intend to include a pasteurization requirement in the standards. A brewery that produces unpasteurized beer is concerned that, after the appropriate proceedings, the Bureau may adopt quality standards that will prohibit the sale of unpasteurized beer. The brewery has sued in federal district court to enjoin the Bureau from adopting standards that would prohibit the sale of unpasteurized beer.

How should the district court proceed with the suit?

A. Determine whether the Bureau could reasonably believe that pasteurization is the safest process by which to brew beer and, if so, refuse to issue the injunction against the Bureau.
B. Determine whether the process used by the brewery is as safe as pasteurization and, if so, issue the injunction against the Bureau.
C. Refuse to adjudicate the merits of the suit at this time and stay the action until the Bureau has actually issued beer-quality standards.
D. Refuse to adjudicate the merits of the suit and dismiss it, because it docs not involve a justiciable case or controversy.

Question #138.
OA304: Chelsea Manning & More

A landowner entered into a single contract with a builder to have three different structures built on separate pieces of property owned by the landowner, Each structure was distinct from the other two, and the parties agreed on a specific price for each. After completing the first structure in accordance with the terms of the contract, the builder demanded payment of the specified price for that structure. At the same time, the builder told the landowner that the builder was "tired of the construction business" and would not even begin the other two structures. The landowner refused to pay anything to the builder.

Is the builder likely to prevail in a suit for the agreed-upon price of the first structure?

A. No, because substantial performance is a constructive condition to the landownerâ€™s duty to pay at the contract rate.
B. No, because the builder's cessation of performance without legal excuse was a willful breach of the contract.
C. Yes, because the contract is divisible, and the landowner will be required to bring a separate claim for the builder's failure to complete the other two structures,
D. Yes, because the contract is divisible, but the landowner will be able to deduct any recoverable damages caused by the builder's failure to complete the contract.

A. No, because character is an essential element of the offense and must be proven by specific instances of conduct.
B. Yes, to prove that the plaintiff is a thief and to reduce or refute the damages claimed.
C. Yes, to prove the plaintiff is a thief but not on damages.
D. Yes, to reduce or refute the damages claimed, but not to prove that the plaintiff is a thief.

Question #140.
OA306: From Gavin Grimm to Jeffrey Epstein

An uncle was the record title holder of a vacant tract of land. He often told friends that he would leave the land to his nephew in his will. The nephew knew of these conversations.

OA314: The Supreme Court and Trump's Asylum Rules

A buyer and a seller entered into a written contract for the sale of an identified parcel of land. The contract expressly provided that the buyer was to pay $150,000 cash for the land at the time of the closing but did not state the closing date. The parties had not agreed on the closing date because the buyer was not sure at the time the contract was signed how she would raise the cash.

Fifteen days after the contract was signed, the seller learned that he could sell the land to a third party for $200,000.

The seller asked the buyer if she would agree to rescind the contract. The buyer refused. The seller then told her that he would not complete the transaction, contending that the contract was unenforceable under the statute of frauds because an essential element (time for performance) was not agreed upon by the parties and was not expressly stated in the written agreement. The seller sold the land to the third party.

The buyer brought an appropriate action against the seller for breach of contract.

For which party is the court likely to find?

A. The buyer, because of the doctrine of unjust enrichment.
B. The buyer, because the court will infer that performance within a reasonable time was intended.
C. The seller, because the contract is unenforceable under the statute of frauds.
D. The seller, because time of performance is presumed to be of the essence.

OA316: Unsealing Mueller's Grand Jury Testimony & Other Yodel Mountain Madness

Four men are being tried for conspiracy to commit a series of bank robberies. Nine successful bank robberies took place during the period of the charged conspiracy. Because the robbers wore masks and gloves and stole the bank surveillance tapes, no witnesses have been able to directly identify the robbers. Some circumstantial evidence ties each of the men to the overall conspiracy. During cross-examination, a prosecution witness testified that one of the men was in jail on other charges during the last six robberies. That manâ€™s lawyer has moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the government's case.

Should the motion be granted?

A. No, because a conspirator is not required to agree to all of the objectives of the conspiracy.
B. No, because a conspirator need not be present at the commission of each crime conspired upon.
C. Yes, provided that the man has complied with the rule requiring pretrial notice of alibi.
D. Yes, regardless of compliance with the alibi rule, because the government is bound by exculpatory evidence elicited during its case-in-chief.

OA318: Quid Pro Quo Burger

A seller and a buyer entered into a contract obligating the seller to convey title to a parcel of land to the buyer in exchange for $100,000. The agreement provided that the buyer's obligation to purchase the parcel was expressly conditioned upon the buyer's obtaining a loan at an interest rate no higher than 10%. The buyer was unable to do so but did obtain a loan at an interest rate of 10.5% and timely tendered the purchase price. Because the value of the land had increased since the time of contracting, the seller refused to perform. The buyer sued the seller.

Is the buyer likely to prevail?

A. No, because an express condition will be excused only to avoid forfeiture.
B. No, because the contract called for a loan at an interest rate not to exceed 10% and it could not be modified without the consent of the seller.
C. Yes, because the buyer detrimentally changed position in reliance on the seller's promise to convey.
D. Yes, because the buyer's obtaining a loan at an interest rate no higher than 10% was not a condition to the seller's duty to perform.

At the time of the incident, the pond was clearly marked with numerous signs that stated, "THIN ICE-KEEP OFF." When the child sneaked away from the day-care center, the center was staffed with a reasonable number of qualified employees, and the employees were exercising reasonable care to ensure that the children in their charge did not leave the premises. There had not been a previous instance of a child coming onto the corporation's property from the day-care center. The jurisdiction follows a rule of pure comparative negligence.

In a suit brought on the child's behalf against the corporation and based only on the facts above, who is likely to prevail?

A. The child, because the corporation owes a duty to keep its premises free of dangerous conditions.
B. The child, because the pond was an attractive nuisance.

OA326: When the SCIF Hit the Fan

An innkeeper, who had no previous experience in the motel or commercial laundry business and who knew nothing about the trade usages of either business, bought a motel and signed an agreement with a laundry company for the motel's laundry services. The agreement was for a term of one year and provided for "daily service at $500 a week." From their conversations during negotiation, the laundry company owner knew that the innkeeper expected laundry services seven days a week.

The rancher delayed because he had other customers to attend to.

OA378: Trump's Stupid Threat to "Adjourn" the Senate (A Primer on Appointments)

A niece had worked in her aunt's bookstore for many years. The bookstore business, which was housed in a building that the aunt leased, was independently appraised at $200,000. The aunt decided to retire. She wrote to the niece, expressing her affection for the niece and offering to sell her the bookstore business for $125,000 if the landlord would agree to a transfer of the lease. The letter also specified when the aunt would transfer the business. The niece wrote back accepting her aunt's offer. In a phone call to the niece, the aunt stated that the landlord had approved the transfer of the lease and that she would now ask her attorney to draft a written contract so that there would be a record of the terms. Before the attorney had finished drafting the document, the aunt changed her mind about selling the business and informed the niece of her decision.

Question #182.
OA394: The Amicus Show!

A landowner borrowed $100,000 from a lender and executed a valid mortgage on a commercial tract of land to secure the debt. The lender promptly recorded the mortgage.

A year later, the landowner conveyed the same tract to a developer by a deed that expressly stated that the conveyance was subject to the mortgage to the lender and that the grantee expressly assumed and agreed to pay the mortgage obligation as part of the consideration for the purchase. The mortgage was properly described in the deed, and the deed was properly executed by the landowner; however, because there was no provision or place in the deed for the developer to sign, he did not do so. The developer promptly recorded the deed.

The developer made the monthly mortgage payments of principal and interest for six payments but then stopped payments and defaulted on the mortgage obligation. The lender properly instituted foreclosure procedures in accordance with the governing law: After the foreclosure sale, there was a $10,000 deficiency due to the lender. Both the landowner and the developer had sufficient assets to pay the deficiency. There is no applicable statute in the jurisdiction other than the statute relating to foreclosure proceedings.

At the appropriate stage of the foreclosure action, which party will the court decide is responsible for payment of the deficiency?

A. The developer, because he accepted delivery of the deed from the landowner and in so doing accepted the terms and conditions of the deed.
B. The developer, because he is estopped by his having made six monthly payments to the lender.
C. The landowner, because the developer was not a signatory to the deed.
D. The landowner, because he was the maker of the note and the mortgage, and at most the developer is liable only as a guarantor of the landownerâ€™s obligation.

Question #183.
OA396: Happy Juneteenth from the Supreme Court!

A private university is owned and operated by a religious organization. The university is accredited by the department of education of the state in which it is located. This accreditation certifies that the university meets prescribed educational standards. Because it is accredited, the university qualifies for state funding for certain of its operating expenses. Under this funding program, 25 percent of the university's total operating budget comes from state funds.

A professor at the university was a part-time columnist for the local newspaper. In one of her published columns, the professor argued that "religion has become a negative force in society." The university subsequently discharged the professor, giving as its sole reason for the dismissal her authorship and publication of this column,

The professor sued the university, claiming only that her discharge violated her constitutional right to freedom of speech.

The university moved to dismiss the professor's lawsuit on the ground that the U.S. Constitution does not provide the professor with a cause of action in this case.

Should the court grant the university's motion to dismiss?

A. Yes, because the First and Fourteenth Amendments protect the right of the university to employ only individuals who share and communicate its views.
B. Yes, because the action of the university in discharging the professor is not attributable to the state for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.
C. No, because the accreditation and partial funding of the university by the state are sufficient to justify the conclusion that the state was an active participant in the discharge of the professor.
D. No, because the U.S. Constitution provides a cause of action against any state-accredited institution that restricts freedom of speech as a condition of employment.

A. No, because a determination of the sufficiency of the evidence is solely within the jury's province.
B. No, because the wholesaler did not raise the sufficiency-of-the-evidence issue in a motion for judgment as a matter of law before the case went to the jury.
C. Yes, because the challenge was raised and ruled on by the trial court before the wholesaler filed the appeal.
D. Yes, because, as the trial court acknowledged, the wholesaler has strong arguments on the challenge.

OA446: Republicans Obliterate the Constitution in Texas v. Pennsylvania

A man was flipping through a manufacturer's catalogue one day and noticed that the manufacturer produces deck chairs. Interested in a set of four for his house, the man called the manufacturer and spoke with the salesperson. The parties orally agreed that the man would purchase four standard chairs for $600. The man said he might be able to come pick them up, and the salesperson replied that they would "make the necessary arrangements with a shipping company." Nothing else regarding delivery was mentioned.

The manufacturer immediately began work on the chairs. The next day, the man found different chairs that he liked better from another source. He sent an email to the manufacturer, stating the following: "I am no longer interested in purchasing the four chairs from you that we agreed upon yesterday. I am sorry for the inconvenience." He signed his name at the bottom of the email. While the manufacturer saw that he had an email from the man, the e-mail was not opened before the chairs were completed. The manufacturer arranged with a local shipping company to have the chairs shipped to the manâ€™s billing address, delivered the chairs to the shipping company, and sent the man a new email stating that the chairs were on the way. The email from the man was then read, but it was too late as the chairs had already been shipped.

Unfortunately the chairs were damaged while in the shipping companyâ€™s possession. When they were delivered to the man, he refused to pay for them. The manufacturer brought a claim for breach of contract.

Who is likely to prevail?

A. The manufacturer, because the manufacturer relied on the manâ€™s promise to buy the chairs.
B. The manufacturer, because the risk of loss had shifted to the man.
C. The man, because there is no enforceable contract.
D. The man, because the chairs were damaged in transit.

The city official asserted a claim of immunity, arguing that he did not have to stand trial. He also filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The court denied both of the city official's requests. The official wanted to immediately appeal all three decisions before trial and sought the advice of his attorney.

Which of the following is the best and most accurate piece of advice the attorney could give?

A man was arrested as the main suspect in a murder investigation. He was brought into an interrogation room, but was not read his Miranda rights. A police officer asked the man, "Where were you on the night of May 2?" The man proceeded to confess to the murder. He also told the officer
where to find the murder weapon. The officer immediately left the room, and he then realized that he accidentally forgot to read the man his Miranda rights. He reported his mistake to the chief, who decided to place the man in a holding cell while they searched for the weapon. The weapon was recovered. Two days later, the man was brought back into the interrogation room where he was questioned by a different officer. Prior to questioning, this officer properly read the man his Miranda rights. The man stated that he understood his rights and repeated his confession, although he left out any discussion of the murder weapon.

At his trial, the man admitted that both of his statements were voluntarily made, but argued that they should each be suppressed, along with the weapon, all of which were fruit of a Miranda violation.

Which, if any, pieces of evidence should be suppressed?

A. Both of the confessions and the weapon should be suppressed.
B. The first confession and the weapon should be suppressed, but the second confession should be admitted.
C. The first confession should be suppressed, but the weapon and the second confession should be admitted.

OA456: Insurrections Have Consequences

A state law provides funding for public students using a complex formula. One of the major components of the formula takes into account property values surrounding the schools. This leads to a disparity in student funding as schools located in areas where property values are high have substantially more funding than schools located in areas where property values are not high. A group of students from a school located in an area with low property values challenges this law on the basis that it violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Who will prevail?

A. The state, because the state can show that the law is necessary to achieve a compelling government interest.
B. The state, because the students will not be able to show that the law is not rationally related to any legitimate government interest.
C. The students, because the students will be able to show that the law is not substantially related to an important government interest.

OA460: Did the Courts Really "Refuse to Hear Trump's Evidence" of Voter Fraud? (No.)

A landlord commercially leased his building to a woman who intended to open an ice cream shop. The woman installed an extensive amount of equipment in the building, which was permitted by the lease agreement, and she began making ice cream. She stored her ice cream in a freezer. However, the building's cooling system broke and her ice cream all melted. She asked the landlord to fix the cooling system, but he refused. She had to temporarily close her store while searching for a mechanic to fix the cooling system.

While the building was unusable for the purpose of storing ice cream, the woman remained on the premises to work on new marketing projects. Angry at the landlord for not fixing the cooling system, which has still not been fixed, the woman refused to make the next rent payment. The landlord began eviction proceedings, and in response, the woman sued the landlord for breach.

Assuming the lease agreement is silent on this matter, who will prevail?

A. The landlord, because the woman had no legal reason for withholding rent payments.
B. The landlord, because the woman surrendered the property when she did not pay rent.
C. The woman, because the landlord breached the implied warranty of habitability.

Twenty days after being served, the retailer, which is incorporated in State C and has its principal place of business in State B, filed a notice of removal in a federal district court in State B.

Was the action properly removed?

Question #219.
OA474: FBI "Faked" Kavanaugh Investigation?!

A man owned a house where he lived with his family. The man was convicted of selling large quantities of an illegal drug from his house. Acting under a state law authorizing the destruction of buildings that are used for illegal activity, the city destroyed the manâ€™s house.

The manâ€™s family then rented an apartment and demanded that the city pay the rent for that temporary residence. The family relied on a state law providing that any person who was dispossessed of his or her place of residence because of the actions of city officials was entitled to replacement housing at the cityâ€™s expense until permanent substitute housing could be found. When the city refused to pay the rent for the apartment, the manâ€™s family sued the city in a state trial court claiming a right to such payment under both the state law and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

The highest state court ruled for the family. Although the court decided that the family had no right to payment under the state law, it held that the Fourteenth Amendment entitled the family to payment of the rent for the temporary apartment. In its opinion, the highest state court indicated that in several of its decisions it had found cities liable for compensation in similar situations on the basis of the due process Clause of the state constitution. But the highest state court declined to base its holding on the state constitution because that issue had not been properly raised in the case.

The city then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court.

Does the Court have jurisdiction to review the merits of this case?

A. Yes, because the highest state court based its decision wholly on federal law grounds.
B. Yes, because the federal and state law issues in this case are so intertwined that a resolution of the federal law issues is necessary to facilitate a proper determination of the state law issues.
C. No, because the decision of the highest state court renders the case moot.
D. No, because independent state law grounds could have been used to justify the result in this case.

Question #220.
OA476: Sidney Powell's Defense Is Even Worse Than You Think

A sporting goods shop contracted with a publisher to buy, for sale in its store, 1,200 posters featuring a professional golfer. During production, the image of the golfer was inadvertently reversed and the right-handed golfer appeared to be left-handed. When the posters were delivered on the date provided in the contract, the sporting goods shop noticed the discrepancy, which had no provable significant impact on the effectiveness of the poster. In the opinion of the shop management, however, the posters did not look as good as they had in the catalog from which the shop had ordered them. Is the sporting goods shop legally entitled to reject the posters?

A. No, because the nonconformity does not materially alter the value of the posters to the sporting goods shop.
B. No, because the publisher must be given an opportunity to cure the nonconformity before the sporting goods shop can reject the posters.
C. Yes, because the posters do not conform to the contract.
D. Yes, because the publisher has breached an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.

OA480: Why Both Sides of the Chauvin Trial Cite Graham v. Connor

A 50-year-old nurse who had been fired from his job at a hospital told his attorney, "I was fired because of my age, and I want to sue the hospital."

Based on this information, the attorney filed an age discrimination complaint against the hospital in federal court. As it turned out, the hospital had hired a 52-year-old man as the nurseâ€™s replacement, a fact that rendered an age discrimination claim unavailable. The hospital responded to the complaint by filing a motion for sanctions against the nurseâ€™s attorney.

Is the court likely to grant the hospital's motion?

A. No, because sanctions are not proper against the attorney of a represented party.
B. No, because the hospital failed to give the attorney the chance to withdraw the complaint in advance of filing the motion with the court.
C. Yes, because the nurseâ€™s attorney failed to conduct a reasonable pre-filing inquiry.
D. Yes, because the nurseâ€™s complaint contained legal contentions that were not warranted by existing law based on the facts in this case.

Question #223.
OA482: Justice for Daunte Wright

A daughter was appointed guardian of her elderly father following an adjudication of his mental incompetence. The father had experienced periods of dementia during which he did not fully understand what he was doing. The father later contracted to purchase an automobile at a fair price from a seller who was unaware of the guardianship. At the time of the purchase, the father was lucid and fully understood the nature and purpose of the transaction.

What is the legal status of the transaction?

A. The contract is enforceable, because a reasonable per- son in the situation of the seller would have thought that the father had the capacity to make the contract.
B. The contract is enforceable, because it was made on fair terms and the seller had no knowledge of the fatherâ€™s guardianship.
C. The contract is void, because the father was under guardianship at the time it was made.
D. The contract is voidable at the option of the father.

Question #224.
OA484: Chauvin Guilty! What To Expect Next

Two sisters own a single tract of land as tenants in common, each holding a one-half interest. The younger sister entered into a three-year written lease with a tenant; the lease described by metes and bounds a specified portion of the land, which consisted of about 40% of the total tract. The tenant went into sole possession of the leased portion of the land.

The older sister has sued both the younger sister and the tenant to establish the older sister's right to possession of the leased portion of the land.

Who is likely to prevail?

A. The older sister, because the younger sister cannot unilaterally partition the land without the older sister's consent.
B. The older sister, because the younger sister may not lease her undivided interest in the land without the older sister's consent.
C. The younger sister and the tenant, because the older sister has been excluded only from the specified portion of the land subject to the lease, which makes up less than one-half of the land's total area.
D. The younger sister and the tenant, because the younger sister's lease to the tenant was necessarily for less than a fee simple interest.

Question #225.
OA486: Apportionment Might NOT Be Final

A state law prohibits any barbershop licensed by the state from displaying posters in support of any current candidate for public office or displaying or distributing any campaign literature in support of such a candidate. No other kinds of posters or literature are subject to this prohibition, nor are any other types of commercial establishments in the state subject to similar prohibitions.
Is this law constitutional?

A. No, because it treats barbershops differently from other commercial establishments.
B. No, because it imposes a restriction on the content or subject matter of speech in the absence of any evidence that such a restriction is necessary to serve a compelling state interest.
C. Yes, because it leaves political candidates free to communicate their campaign messages to voters by other means.
D. Yes, because the operation of a licensed barbershop is a privilege and therefore is subject to any reasonable restriction imposed by the state.

Question #226.
OA488: A New Trial for Chauvin?

Upon learning that the agent would be giving testimony during the trial, the defendant moved that the agent also be excluded from the courtroom.

Should the defendantâ€™s motion be granted?

A. No, provided that the government can show that the agentâ€™s presence is essential to the presentation of its case.
B. No, because the government has a right to have its designated representative remain in the courtroom throughout the trial.
C. Yes, because the agent's testimony might be influenced by the testimony of other witnesses.
D. Yes, because the defendant has a right to exclude all persons who may be called as government witnesses.

OA490: Chauvin Sentencing - Four Aggravating Factors

A man entered a tavern in an obviously intoxicated condition, was refused service, and was ordered to leave and escorted out. Just after leaving the tavern, the man staggered across the road toward a liquor store. As he was crossing the road, the man was struck by a car and severely injured.

The man sued the tavern for his personal injuries. At trial, the evidence established the facts as set out above.

At the close of the evidence, both parties moved for judgment as a matter of law.

How should the court rule on these motions?

A. Deny both motions and submit the case to the jury, because reasonable jurors could conclude that the accident was foreseeable.
B. Deny both motions and submit the case to the jury, because a tavern is a place of public accommodation.
C. Grant the tavernâ€™s motion, because there is no evidence that the tavern breached a duty to the man.
D. Grant the manâ€™s motion, because it is undisputed that by being ejected from the tavern, the man was put at risk.

OA492: Court Locks Mississippi Citizens Out of Amending Their Own Constitution

An attempt was made to hijack a commercial airliner while it was in flight from San Francisco to New Orleans. Within minutes, however, the hijacker was seized, and the plane proceeded to its destination. Upon the planeâ€™s arrival, television stations broadcast pictures of the passengers as they disembarked. Among the passengers pictured on television was a businessman who was supposed to be in Chicago on company business. The disclosure that the businessman was in New Orleans and not in Chicago at the time resulted in the loss of his position with his company and great humiliation and embarrassment for him.

If the businessman asserts a claim against the television stations for broadcasting his picture as he disembarked, is he likely to prevail?

A. Yes, because the businessmanâ€™s location was revealed against his wishes.
B. Yes, because publication of the television pictures caused the businessman pecuniary loss.
C. No, because the humiliation and embarrassment did not result in physical harm to the businessman.
D. No, because the scene shown on television was newsworthy.

Question #229.
OA494: Florida's Pointless, Unconstitutional Social Media Law

A protester brought an action in federal court against a police officer, alleging that the officer's use of force in arresting the protester violated the protesterâ€™s federal civil rights.

During the jury trial, eyewitnesses gave conflicting testimony on the arrest. At the close of evidence, the protester moved for judgment as a matter of law, which the court denied.

The court instructed the jury that the protesterâ€™s burden of proof was clear and convincing evidence, rather than the correct burden of preponderance of the evidence. The jury returned a verdict for the officer, and the court entered judgment accordingly.

What is the protesterâ€™s best option for challenging the judgment?

A. Seek a new trial, because the jury instruction affected the protesterâ€™s substantial rights.
B. Seek a new trial, because the verdict was against the clear weight of the evidence.
C. Seek judgment as a matter of law, because the jury did not have legally sufficient evidence to find for the officer.
D. Seek judgment as a matter of law, because the juryâ€™s findings were clearly erroneous.

Question #230.
OA496: Stanford Law Forgets How Law Works

A company contracted with a builder to construct a new corporate headquarters for a fixed price of $100 million. At the time of the contract, structural steel was widely available and was included in the contract as a $6 million item. Before work began on the project, tornado damage shut down the production facility of the biggest structural steel supplier in the country, and the price of structural steel increased by 20% as a result. The builder informed the company of the steel price increase, and the parties then orally agreed to increase the project price to $101 million.

The builder proceeded with construction and delivered the project on time. The company paid the builder $100 million but refused to pay the additional $1 million.

If the builder sues the company for $1 million, is the builder likely to prevail?

A. No, because the modification was never reduced to a writing signed by the party to be charged.
B. No, because there was no consideration for the modification of the contract.
C. Yes, because the companyâ€™s promise was supported by consideration.
D. Yes, because the modification was fair and equitable in view of the unanticipated increase in the price of structural steel.

Question #231.
OA498: The Garland DoJ Coverage is Completely Wrong

At a defendant's trial for extortion, the prosecutor called a witness expecting her to testify that she had heard the defendant threaten a man with physical harm unless the man made payoffs to the defendant. The witness denied ever having heard the defendant make such threats, even though she had testified to that effect before the grand jury. The prosecutor now seeks to admit the witnessâ€™s grand jury testimony.

How should the court rule with regard to the grand jury testimony?

A. Admit the testimony, because it contains a statement by a party-opponent.
B. Admit the testimony, both for impeachment and for substantive use, because the witness made the inconsistent statement under oath at a formal proceeding.
C. Admit the testimony under the former testimony exception to the hearsay rule.
D. Exclude the testimony for substantive use, because it is a testimonial statement.

Question #232.
OA500: Eminent Domain!

A man arranged to have custom-made wooden shutters installed on the windows of his home. The contractor who installed the shutters did so by drilling screws and brackets into the exterior window frames and the shutters.

The man later agreed to sell the home to a buyer. The sales agreement did not mention the shutters, the buyer did not inquire about them, and the buyer did not conduct a walkthrough inspection of the home before the closing.

The man conveyed the home to the buyer by warranty deed. After the sale closed, the buyer noticed that the shutters and brackets had been removed from the home and that the window frames had been repaired and repainted.

The buyer demanded that the man return the shutters and pay the cost of reinstallation, claiming that the shutters had been conveyed to him with the sale of the home. When the man refused, the buyer sued.

Is the buyer likely to prevail?

A. No, because the sales agreement did not mention the shutters.
B. No, because the window frames had been repaired and repainted after removal of the shutters.
C. Yes, because the shutters had become fixtures.
D. Yes, because the man gave the buyer a warranty deed and the absence of the shutters violated a covenant of the deed.

Question #233.
OA502: Why Critical Race Theory is Indispensable

The president of a pharmaceutical firm received a report from his testing bureau that a manufactured lot of the firmâ€™s anti-cancer prescription medication was well below strength. Concerned about being able to fulfill contractual commitments, the president instructed his staff to deliver the defective lot. A cancer patient who had been maintained on the drug died shortly after beginning to take the defective pills. Medical evidence established that the patient would have lived longer had the drug been at full strength, but would have died before long in any event.

The president was convicted of murder. On appeal, he argues that his conviction should be reversed.

Should the conviction be reversed?

A. No, because the intentional delivery of adulterated or mislabeled drugs gives rise to strict criminal liability.
B. No, because the jury could have found that the presidentâ€™s conduct was sufficiently reckless to constitute murder.
C. Yes, because distribution of the defective lot was only a regulatory offense.

A man brought a federal diversity action against his insurance company, alleging that the company had breached its duty under his insurance policy by refusing to pay for his medical expenses resulting from a mountain-biking accident.

At the jury trial, the man presented evidence that he had paid all premiums on the insurance policy and that the policy covered personal-injury-related medical expenses arising from accidents. After he rested his case, the company presented evidence that a provision of the policy excluded payment for injury-related expenses resulting from an insuredâ€™s "unduly frisky" behavior. The company also presented a witness who testified that the accident had occurred in an area where posted signs warmed bikers not to enter. The man did not cross-examine the witness.

After resting its case, the company moved for judgment as a matter of law.

Should the court grant the motion?

A. No, because a motion for judgment as a matter of law must first be made at the close of the plaintiffs case-in-chief.
B. No, because whether the manâ€™s behavior was unduly risky is a question of fact for the jury to resolve.
C. Yes, because the companyâ€™s uncontradicted evidence of the manâ€™s unduly risky behavior means that no reasonable jury could find that the policy covers his injuries.
D. Yes, because the man waived his right to rebut the companyâ€™s evidence by not addressing the "unduly risky" policy provision in his case-in-chief.

OA532: OK I'll Bite What is the Debt Ceiling

A man lives in a remote area in the Upper Peninsula of State A. Since he lives so far from town, he prefers to make one large trip to the local convenience store each month to purchase all of his supplies. During the winter, the area gets so much snow that the roads are often un-passable by vehicle. Thus, the man decided he wanted to purchase a state-of-the-art snowmobile that would allow him to transport his supplies back and forth from town. Since the best deals are during the summer, the man went to purchase his snowmobile in July. He asked the salesperson to show him "the best snowmobile you've got." The salesperson took him over to a large snowmobile with red and white stripes. The salesperson said, "I think this is exactly what you're looking for!" The box advertised that the snowmobile could carry up to 200 pounds. Impressed, the man replied "I'll take one! But can I get it one with blue and black stripes?" The salesperson readily agreed and said it would be delivered in one week.

The correct model snowmobile with blue and black stripes was indeed delivered on time the next week. The man was very happy and accepted the snowmobile. When the first snowfall hit in November, the man tried to take it to the store to purchase his supplies. On his way back, with 100 pounds of supplies on the snowmobile, the snowmobile kept stalling due to the weight of the supplies. He had to call for help because the snowmobile could not get him home. When he called the store, he was told that there was a problem with the bearings in that model that prevented it from operating correctly when carrying heavy loads. However, it still works properly in every other scenario. The man asked for his money back.

B. Yes, because the man properly revoked his acceptance of the snowmobile.
C. No, because a perfect tender delivery was made and the man did not properly reject the snowmobile.

An attorney represented a client who was the plaintiff in a personal injury action. After the action had settled, the attorney received a check in the amount of $10,000 payable to the attorney, which she deposited in her client trust account. The next day, the attorney received a letter from a bank. The bank informed the attorney that the client had failed to make mortgage payments on a residential building for the last three months and demanded that the attorney immediately release $3,000 of the settlement proceeds to the bank to avert immediate foreclosure proceedings against the client. When the attorney, who did not represent the client in the mortgage matter, informed the client of the bankâ€™s letter, the client did not dispute the $3,000 debt but expressed no concern for what the bank might do. The client believed that the building was essentially worthless, so he assumed that the bank would never foreclose. The client instructed the attorney to take her legal fees from the settlement and turn the rest of the proceeds over to him. The attorney followed the client's instructions.

OA576: Election Laws and Lies, with Lawrence Lessig

An attorney represented the wife in an acrimonious divorce proceeding involving issues of property division and child custody. After one day of trial, the husband, through his lawyer, made a settlement offer. The proposed settlement required that the wifeâ€™s attorney agree not to represent the wife in any subsequent proceeding, brought by either party, to modify or enforce the provisions of the decree. The wife wanted to accept the offer, and her attorney reasonably believed that it was in the wifeâ€™s best interest to do so because the settlement offer was better than any potential award to the wife resulting from the case going to judgment. Consequently, the attorney recommended to the wife that she accept the offer.

Was it proper for the wifeâ€™s attorney to recommend that the wife accept the settlement offer?

A. No, because the attorney did not obtain the wifeâ€™s informed consent to the conflict of interest created by the proposed settlement.
B. No, because the proposed settlement restricted the attorneyâ€™s right to represent the wife in the future.
C. Yes, because the restriction on the attorney was limited to subsequent proceedings in the same matter.

OA580: Google Caught Pulling Privilege Shenanigans

An attorney represented a client in a breach of contract action against the client's former business partner.

The prior litigation had been resolved in the former partner's favor. Neither the attorney nor the client had been involved in any way in the prior litigation. However, at the time of the prior litigation, the client and the former partner had had a close personal and business relationship.

Was the attorney's conduct proper?

A. Yes, because the attorney believed that the disclosure would be detrimental to the client's best interests.

A defendant is charged with homicide after the defendant was involved in a car accident that killed a pedestrian. At the defendant's trial, the prosecution called to the stand a shop-owner who testified that immediately after the accident, a witness ran into his store and said, "Whoa! Can I use your phone?

OA601: SCOTUS Ruling Guarantees More Innocent Will Be Put to Death

A restaurant headquartered in state a was the subject of multiple premises, liability suits, stemming from a spill on the floor that caused multiple injuries.

Plaintiff 1 sued the restaurant in state court located in state A for negligence. In that suit, it was determined after a full litigation that the employees of the corporation were aware of the spill on the floor and did have a duty to warn the plaintiff of the spill. Following a full trial, plaintiff 1 succeeded in her suit against the restaurant. The restaurant filed an appeal and that appeal is still pending. Plaintiff 2 filed suit against the restaurant in federal court located in state B. Plaintiff 2 sought to preclude the restaurant from asserting that it did not owe a duty to warn of the spill under collateral estoppel. The law of State A allows for the use of offensive non-mutual collateral estoppel.

The law of State B prohibits the use of offensive non-mutual collateral estoppel. Federal law allows for the use of collateral estoppel as justice permits. The law in all three jurisdictions states that a judgment is final until reversed or otherwise modified assumed jurisdiction and venue are proper.

What should the court do?

A. Allow the restaurant to litigate the issue of its duty to warn, because the federal court will apply the law of the state in which it sits.
B. Evaluate whether justice would allow the use of non-mutual collateral estoppel because the federal law will apply its own law on procedural issues.
C. Prohibit the restaurant from litigating the issue of its duty to warn because the federal court will apply the law of state A.
D. Delay the case until the appeal is decided.

Question #R003
Thomas Takes the Bar Exam Returns! T3BE Week 1

A doctor who was licensed to practice medicine in a particular state was convicted in state court of improperly distributing specified drugs by writing prescriptions for fictitious persons. Under state law, such an abuse of the prescription-writing privilege requires revocation of a doctor's license. After it received an official notification of the doctor's conviction, the state medical board revoked the doctor's license without affording the doctor any opportunity for a hearing.

The doctor has sued the board in state court to set aside the revocation, alleging deprivation of property without due process of law because the board did not provide an opportunity for a trial-type hearing before revoking the license. The doctor does not deny the conviction or the factual basis for it.

Which of the following is the strongest argument in support of the state medical board?

A. A doctorâ€™s license to practice is a privilege, not a right, and therefore is not property within the meaning of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
B. Due process requires a balancing of interests, and the stateâ€™s interest in preventing drug abuse outweighs the doctorâ€™s interest in the particular procedure followed in the disciplinary proceeding.
C. The adjudicative facts necessary to revoke the doctor's license were determined in the criminal trial, and therefore due process does not require any further trial-type hearing.
D. The licensing board was required to summarily revoke the doctor's license because Article IV, Section 1, of the Constitution requires the licensing board to give full faith and credit to the doctor's criminal conviction.

Question #R005
T3BE Week 2!

A nightclub owner applied for a required zoning permit to open a nude-dancing nightclub in the theater district of a city. An organization of influential city residents began an intensive lobbying effort to persuade the city council to deny the owner a permit to operate any type of nude-dancing facility at any time or in any place in the city.

The owner has sued the city in an appropriate federal court, seeking an injunction that would prohibit the city council from considering the organizationâ€™s views, on the ground that if the organization is successful in its lobbying efforts, the owner's First and Fourteenth Amendment rights would be violated. The city has moved to dismiss the action.

Should the court dismiss the ownerâ€™s action?

A. No, because nude dancing is symbolic speech and is therefore protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
B. No, because the organization does not seek a reasonable time, place, and manner regulation of nude dancing, but instead seeks a total ban on the ownerâ€™s opening any type of nude-dancing facility at any time or in any place in the city.
C. Yes, because the action is not ripe.

Question #R011
T3BE Week 5! Personal Injury and Comparative Negligence

A bright 12-year-old child attended a day-care center after school. The center was located near a man-made duck pond on the property of a corporation. During the winter, the pond was used for ice-skating when conditions were suitable. At a time when the pond was obviously only partially frozen, the child sneaked away from the centerâ€™s property and walked out onto the ice over the pond. The ice gave way, and the child fell into the cold water. He suffered shock and would have drowned had he not been rescued by a passerby. At the time of the incident, the pond was clearly marked with numerous signs that stated, "THIN ICE-KEEP OFF." When the child sneaked away from the day-care center, the center was staffed with a reasonable number of qualified employees, and the employees were exercising reasonable care to ensure that the children in their charge did not leave the premises. There had not been a previous instance of a child coming onto the corporationâ€™s property from the day-care center. The jurisdiction follows a rule of pure comparative negligence.

In a suit brought on the childâ€™s behalf against the day-care center and based only on the facts above, who is likely to prevail?

A. The child, because he left the center while he was under the centerâ€™s care.
B. The child, because the day-care center is located near a pond.
C. The day-care center, because it was not negligent.
D. The day-care center, because the child was a trespasser.

Question #R012
T3BE Week 6 - ROCKED by Scandal #T3BEgate2

A state constitution provides that in every criminal trial "the accused shall have the right to confront all witnesses against him face to face." A defendant was convicted in state court of child abuse based on testimony from a six-year-old child. The child testified while she was seated behind one-way glass, which allowed the defendant to see the child but did not allow the child to see the defendant. The defendant appealed to the state's highest court, claiming that the inability of the child to see the defendant while she testified violated both the United States Constitution and the state constitution. Without addressing the federal constitutional issue, the state's highest court reversed the defendant's conviction and ordered a new trial. The court held that "the constitution of this state is clear, and it requires that while testifying in a criminal trial, a witness must be able to see the defendant." The state petitioned the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari.

On which ground should the United States Supreme Court DENY the state's petition?

A. A state may not seek appellate review in the United States Supreme Court of the reversal of a criminal conviction by its highest court.

B. The decision of the state's highest court was based on adequate and independent state ground.

C. The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution does not require that a witness against a criminal defendant be able to see the defendant while the witness testifies.

D. The decision of the state's highest court requires a new trial, and therefore it is not a final judgment.

T3BE Week 8! Elaborate Crimes and Psychedelics

Claire, a disgruntled employee, was determined to disrupt her company's annual charity gala. She believed her company was using the charity event to launder money. So, she decided to protest by tampering with the company's new software system, which was set to be unveiled at the gala. Claire had been involved in the development of the system and knew that an excessive amount of data could cause the system to crash. So, she started feeding irrelevant and bogus data into the system. At the gala, when the system was unveiled and the influx of information started to pour in, the system crashed as Claire had planned. The gala came to a halt and the incident resulted in significant reputational damage for the company.

However, unbeknownst to Claire, the software system was also utilized in the operation of local emergency services, which experienced a temporary shutdown when the system crashed. This resulted in delays in dispatching emergency vehicles, causing a severe injury to be fatal due to the delay in getting the victim to the hospital. The state has a strict liability statute that penalizes anyone who disrupts emergency services. Claire was charged under this statute. She defended herself by claiming she didn't know the software sys tem was used for emergency services, and her intent was solely to disrupt the company's gala.

Given the nature of the strict liability statute, how should the court rule?

A. Claire is guilty because she disrupted the emergency services, regardless of her knowledge or intent.
B. Claire is not guilty because she did not intend to disrupt emergency services.
C. Claire is guilty because she intentionally disrupted the gala, and the disruption of emergency services was a consequence of that.
D. Claire is not guilty because the company didn't inform her that the software system was used for emergency services.

The owner of a building leased it to a manufacturer for 10 years. Among the terms of the lease was a provision that prohibited anyone from assigning any rights under the lease without the express written consent of the owner. Three years later, the manufacturer, facing a contraction of its business, entered into an agreement with a retailer to assume the manufacturer's obligations under the lease for the remaining seven years. The manufacturer did not seek the approval of the owner to this agreement, but the owner was aware of it and accepted the retailer's payment of the rent. With five years remaining on the lease, the retailer entered into an agreement with a distributor for the distributor to lease the building for two years. The retailer sought the owner's permission for this transfer. The owner, because of personal animus toward the distributor, has refused to grant his permission.

Which of the following is an argument that is most likely to compel the owner to accept the distributor as the tenant of the building?

A. The lease provision does not require the owner's approval of the agreement between the retailer and the distributor.
B. The owner waived his rights to object under the lease by accepting the retailer as a tenant.
C. A non-assignment provision constitutes an unreasonable restraining on alienation.
D. The owner does not have a commercially reasonable objection to the distributor as a tenant in the building.

Question #R028
A woman brought suit in State A federal district court against the company she worked for, claiming that it had failed to promote her on account of her gender, in violation of a federal employment-discrimination statute. The woman is a citizen of State A; the company is a corporation incorporated in State B, with its headquarters in State C and with most of its employees working at the office in State A where the woman works. The relief sought by the suit consisted solely of $46,000 in back pay. Two months after the company timely filed its answer, and while discovery was still pending, the company made a motion to dismiss the suit for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.

Will the federal court grant the motion?

A. Yes, because the company is a citizen of several states, one of which is the same as the woman's state of citizenship.
B. Yes, because although there is diversity of citizenship, the amount in controversy requirement is not met.
C. No, because the woman's claim arises under federal law.
D. No, because the company waived its objection by failing to assert it either in its answer or in a motion made before it served its answer.

The vaccination of children against childhood contagious diseases (such as measles, diphtheria, and whooping cough) has traditionally been a function of private doctors and local and state health departments. Because vaccination rates have declined in recent years, the President proposes to appoint a Presidential Advisory Commission on Vaccination which would be charged with conducting a national publicity campaign to encourage vaccination as a public health measure. No federal statute authorizes or prohibits this action by the president. The activities of the Commission would be financed entirely from funds appropriated by Congress to the Office of the President for "such other purposes as the President may think appropriate."

Is the creation of the Commission by the President a constitutional exercise of authority?

A. Yes, because the President has plenary authority to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the people of the United States.
B. Yes, because this action is within the scope of executive authority vested in the President by the Constitution, and no federal statute prohibits it.
C. No, because the protection of children against common diseases by vaccination is a traditional state function, and therefore, is reserved to the states by the Tenth Amendment.
D. No, because Congress has not specifically authorized the creation and support of such a new federal agency.

B. No, because the suspect's statement was not made in response to a question from police.
C. Yes, because the suspect did not receive fresh Miranda warnings before he was told of the cashier's death.

Question #R055
Professor Paula sued developer David in federal court in California under diversity jurisdiction to void a contract due to mistake. The agreement was for David to create an app that would revolutionize grading by making it faster and easier for Paula. David agreed to build the groundbreaking grading app in one year for $150,000. A few months into the project, David realized it would take two years and $300,000 to create the program for Paula, which was more money than her teacher's salary could afford. In the complaint, Paula alleged that David's promise to finish the app for a specific dollar amount "induced plaintiff to mistakenly enter into the contract with defendant for him to build a grading app" and is suing him to cancel the contract. David has timely moved for a more definite statement of the claim.

Should the federal district court grant David's motion for a more definite statement?

A. Yes, because the circumstances constituting mistake must be pled with particularity.
B. Yes, because a complaint must show that there is a possibility that the plaintiff is entitled to relief.
