OA378: Trump's Stupid Threat to "Adjourn" the Senate (A Primer on Appointments)

A niece had worked in her aunt's bookstore for many years. The bookstore business, which was housed in a building that the aunt leased, was independently appraised at $200,000. The aunt decided to retire. She wrote to the niece, expressing her affection for the niece and offering to sell her the bookstore business for $125,000 if the landlord would agree to a transfer of the lease. The letter also specified when the aunt would transfer the business. The niece wrote back accepting her aunt's offer. In a phone call to the niece, the aunt stated that the landlord had approved the transfer of the lease and that she would now ask her attorney to draft a written contract so that there would be a record of the terms. Before the attorney had finished drafting the document, the aunt changed her mind about selling the business and informed the niece of her decision.

In an action for breach of contract brought by the niece against her aunt, is the niece likely to prevail?

A. No, because the motivation for the transfer of the business was the aunt's affection for her niece, not the price.
B. No, because the promised consideration was inadequate in light of the market value of the business.
C. Yes, because the condition concerning the landlord's assent to the transfer of the lease was beyond the control of either party.
D. Yes, because the document being drafted by the attorney was merely a record of an agreement already made, not a condition to it.
