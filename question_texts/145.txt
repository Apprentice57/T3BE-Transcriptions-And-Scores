OA316: Unsealing Mueller's Grand Jury Testimony & Other Yodel Mountain Madness

Four men are being tried for conspiracy to commit a series of bank robberies. Nine successful bank robberies took place during the period of the charged conspiracy. Because the robbers wore masks and gloves and stole the bank surveillance tapes, no witnesses have been able to directly identify the robbers. Some circumstantial evidence ties each of the men to the overall conspiracy. During cross-examination, a prosecution witness testified that one of the men was in jail on other charges during the last six robberies. That manâ€™s lawyer has moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the government's case.

Should the motion be granted?

A. No, because a conspirator is not required to agree to all of the objectives of the conspiracy.
B. No, because a conspirator need not be present at the commission of each crime conspired upon.
C. Yes, provided that the man has complied with the rule requiring pretrial notice of alibi.
D. Yes, regardless of compliance with the alibi rule, because the government is bound by exculpatory evidence elicited during its case-in-chief.
