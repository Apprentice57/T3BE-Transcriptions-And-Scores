OA304: Chelsea Manning & More

A landowner entered into a single contract with a builder to have three different structures built on separate pieces of property owned by the landowner, Each structure was distinct from the other two, and the parties agreed on a specific price for each. After completing the first structure in accordance with the terms of the contract, the builder demanded payment of the specified price for that structure. At the same time, the builder told the landowner that the builder was "tired of the construction business" and would not even begin the other two structures. The landowner refused to pay anything to the builder.

Is the builder likely to prevail in a suit for the agreed-upon price of the first structure?

A. No, because substantial performance is a constructive condition to the landownerâ€™s duty to pay at the contract rate.
B. No, because the builder's cessation of performance without legal excuse was a willful breach of the contract.
C. Yes, because the contract is divisible, and the landowner will be required to bring a separate claim for the builder's failure to complete the other two structures,
D. Yes, because the contract is divisible, but the landowner will be able to deduct any recoverable damages caused by the builder's failure to complete the contract.
