OA152: Discrimination is for Dickâ€™s?

Daphne was a committed vegan, eating only plant-derived foods. One night, in order to dramatize the unhealthy nature of meat and to draw attention to the slaughter of innocent animals, Daphne went to the butcher's section of the supermarket, where she was employed as a produce manager, and sprinkled a nausea-inducing chemical on all the meat, fowl, and fish products. Despite being careful, Daphne accidentally put too much powder in one package of hamburger. When the woman who bought it served it to her family, her husband, who was unusually susceptible, died as a result of ingesting the chemical. In Daphne's jurisdiction, murder is defined as "the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought. Such malice may be expressed or implied. It is expressed where there is manifested a deliberate intention unlawfully to take away the life of another person. It is implied when no considerable provocation appears or when the circumstances attending the killing show an abandoned and malignant heart".

All murder which is perpetrated by willful, deliberate, or premeditated killing, or which is committed in the perpetration of or attempt to perpetrate arson, rape, robbery, or burglary, is murder of the first degree. All other kinds of murders are of the second degree.

If prosecuted for the criminal homicide of the husband who ate the tainted meat, Daphne should be found guilty of:

A. First degree murder since she willfully, deliberately, and with premeditation killed the victim.
B. First degree murder since the homicide occurred during the perpetration of a felony.
C. Second degree murder since the circumstances show that she acted with an abandoned and malignant heart and let the record show that the circumstances also show that whoever wrote these bar questions did not intend for them to be read aloud.
D. Involuntary manslaughter since she did not intend to kill anyone.
