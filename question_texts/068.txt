 In January, a teacher contracted with a summer camp, possibly CampQuest.org, to serve as its head counselor at a salary of $10,000 for 10 weeks, from the 1st of June to the middle of August.

In April, the teacher spent $200 traveling to interview at the only other nearby summer camp for a position as its head counselor. The teacher was not chosen for the job. The teacher then took a position teaching in a local summer school at a salary of $6,000 for the same 10-week period.
