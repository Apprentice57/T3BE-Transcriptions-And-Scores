OA576: Election Laws and Lies, with Lawrence Lessig

An attorney represented the wife in an acrimonious divorce proceeding involving issues of property division and child custody. After one day of trial, the husband, through his lawyer, made a settlement offer. The proposed settlement required that the wife’s attorney agree not to represent the wife in any subsequent proceeding, brought by either party, to modify or enforce the provisions of the decree. The wife wanted to accept the offer, and her attorney reasonably believed that it was in the wife’s best interest to do so because the settlement offer was better than any potential award to the wife resulting from the case going to judgment. Consequently, the attorney recommended to the wife that she accept the offer.

Was it proper for the wife’s attorney to recommend that the wife accept the settlement offer?

A. No, because the attorney did not obtain the wife’s informed consent to the conflict of interest created by the proposed settlement.
B. No, because the proposed settlement restricted the attorney’s right to represent the wife in the future.
C. Yes, because the restriction on the attorney was limited to subsequent proceedings in the same matter.
D. Yes, because the attorney reasonably believed that it was in the wife’s best interest to accept the proposed settlement.
