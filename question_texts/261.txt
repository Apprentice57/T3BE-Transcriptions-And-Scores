OA560: Supreme Court Just Plain Making Sh*t Up In Vaccine Ruling

An attorney was representing a nonprofit organization in merger negotiations with another nonprofit entity. During a review of the client organization's financial records, the attorney discovered that the organization had engaged in activities that jeopardized its nonprofit status. The attorney reasonably concluded that the organization’s failure to report these activities to the other nonprofit entity would constitute a fraud. The attorney had not represented the organization at the time of the activities and had not made any false representations to the other nonprofit entity during the negotiations.

The attorney met with the organization’s board of directors and informed it that he would withdraw from representing the organization in the merger negotiations unless it disclosed to the other nonprofit entity the activities that jeopardized the organization’s nonprofit status. The board refused to disclose the activities and insisted that the attorney continue to represent the organization. The attorney declined and promptly withdrew from the representation without making any disclosures to the other nonprofit entity or to the state tax authorities.

Is the attorney subject to discipline for his conduct in this representation?

A. Yes, because the attorney did not inform the other nonprofit entity that the organization had failed to report the activities that jeopardized the organization's nonprofit status.
B. Yes, because the attorney withdrew from representing the organization in the merger negotiations without the board’s permission.
C. No, because the attorney withdrew from the representation after informing the board of directors about the need to disclose the activities to the other nonprofit entity.
D. No, because the attorney was permitted to withdraw regardless of whether he informed the board of directors of the need to disclose the activities to the other nonprofit entity.
