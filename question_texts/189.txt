OA410: NY AG Files to Dissolve the NRA!

A farmer kept antiques in an uninhabited farmhouse on his property. The farmhouse had been broken into several times in the past, and some of the farmerâ€™s goods had been stolen. Instead of posting "No Trespassing" signs, the farmer decided to install an alarm system to deter intruders.

While the farmer was in the farmhouse installing the alarm system, he heard a window open in the adjoining room. The farmer crept very quietly to the door of the room, threw the door open, and found an intruder, a young child. The farmer immediately struck the child, a 10-year-old girl, very hard in the face, breaking her nose.

In an action on behalf of the child against the farmer to recover for the injury to her nose, is the child likely to prevail?

A. No, because the farmer did not use deadly force.
B. No, because the farmer had probable cause to believe that the child was a thief.
C. Yes, because the farmer should have posted a "No Trespassing" sign.
D. Yes, because the farmer used excessive force.
