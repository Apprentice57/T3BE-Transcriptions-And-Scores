OA452: Another "Expert" Witness Unmasked; Bernie's Filibuster Explained

A factory is located on the edge of a town. The factory is a major producer of plastics, which it supplies to manufacturers across the country. With the development of new technology and products, there is a great demand for a new type of sturdier plastic. In order for the factory to produce this plastic, the factory began using chemical reactions that released a toxic gas into the air. After the factory began production of this plastic, hundreds of citizens in the town started to complain about the gas. It brings with it an unpleasant odor and also causes sickness. This gas has been proven to cause many significant illnesses and thus is jeopardizing the health of the community.

A citizen of the town sues the factory for public nuisance.

Will the citizen recover?

A. Yes, if the use or enjoyment of the citizenâ€™s property has been unreasonably interfered with.
B. Yes, if the citizen has suffered some sort of damages or injuries that are unique to those suffered by the rest of the town.
C. No, if the factory has not acted unreasonably and has taken all feasible precautions to limit the gas.
D. No, if it is deemed that the factory is not acting intentionally to spread the gas across the town.
