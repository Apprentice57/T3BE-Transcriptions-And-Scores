OA522: Roe v. Wade is Dead.

A local bartender owns Blackacre, which is an undeveloped piece of property next to his bar. On March 1, the bartender conveyed Blackacre to an investor who paid value and wanted to build an apartment complex on the property. The investor did not immediately record his interest. On April 1, the bartender sold the still undeveloped Blackacre to his son. The son did not know about the conveyance to the investor. The son immediately recorded the deed. On May 1, the investor recorded the deed and had a construction company start digging on the site. On June 1, the son sold Blackacre to his friend. On July 1, the bartender died. His will left Blackacre to his brother, who immediately recorded the deed. On August 1, the
friend recorded his deed. The jurisdiction has a race-notice recording statute.

In an action to quiet title, who will have priority rights to Blackacre?

A. The investor
B. The son
C. The friend
