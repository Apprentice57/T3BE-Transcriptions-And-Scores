OA337: How to Talk to Your (Republican) Family About Impeachment

A landlord and a tenant orally agreed to a commercial tenancy for a term of six months beginning on July 1. Rent was to be paid by the first day of each month, and the tenant paid the first monthâ€™s rent at the time of the agreement.

When the tenant arrived at the leased premises on July 1, the tenant learned that the previous tenant had not vacated the premises at the end of her lease term on May 31 and did not intend to vacate. The tenant then successfully sued the previous tenant for possession. The tenant did not inform the landlord of the eviction action until after the tenant received possession.

The tenant then sued the landlord, claiming damages for that portion of the lease period during which the tenant was not in possession. If the court finds for the landlord, what will be the most likely explanation?

A. By suing the previous tenant for possession, the tenant elected that remedy in lieu of a suit against the landlord.
B. The landlord had delivered the legal right of possession to the tenant.
C. The tenant failed to timely vacate as required to sue for constructive eviction.
D. The tenant had not notified the landlord before bringing the eviction action.
