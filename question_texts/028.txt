OA78: Jeff Sessions, "Preemptive Executive Privilege," & More on Emoluments

An owner of a pizza and Italian foods restaurant opens a new location on a street where another owner has a burger restaurant. It seems like business is slow for the pizza place owner and he eyes up his competitor, the burger man, as the reason. The pizza owner starts to make false statements about the burger restaurant and its inferior ingredients, which he says have been causing domain poisoning in some of the customers.

When the burger joint owner loses customers and business income to the pizza place owner, can he sue for conversion?

A. Yes, because the pizza owner interfered with his right of peaceful enjoyment and disrupted his business activities.
B. Yes, conversion is an intentional tort and the pizza owner acted intentionally to convert and did convert part of the burger business.
C. No, because conversion consists of appropriating another's real property.
D. No, because there was no interference with his ownership or right of possession to his personal property.
