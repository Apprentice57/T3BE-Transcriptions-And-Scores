OA572: Ukraine and International Law; Gov. Abbott's Despicable Attack on Trans Kids

An attorney in a five-lawyer firm learned that one of her partners had charged personal expenses to a client and had fraudulently represented that the expenses were related to the client's representation. After being confronted with evidence of the fraud, the partner resigned. The attorney disclosed the fraud to the client and directed the law firm’s billing department to refund the fraudulent charges to the client. The attorney asked the client whether the client wanted to disclose the partner’s conduct to the disciplinary authority. The client did not object to the disclosure but left the decision to the attorney.

Is the attorney required to report the partner’s conduct to the disciplinary authority?

A. Yes, because lawyers must report all violations of the rules of professional conduct to disciplinary authorities.
B. Yes, because the conduct raised a substantial question as to the partner's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer.
C. No, because the attorney acted promptly to rectify any damage to the client caused by the partner’s conduct.
D. No, because the attorney owes a continuing fiduciary duty to the partner with respect to matters that occurred during the course of their partnership.
