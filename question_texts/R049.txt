"The Right Way" Part 2

As Chris walked down the street, he noticed a 1970 Dodge Charger was unlocked and the engine was running. A security guard, Vince, owned the car and parked it in front of his house while he ran in and grabbed the gun that he was licensed to carry. At the same time Vince came out of his front door with the gun, Chris opened the driver's side door to the car. Vince warned Chris not to get in the car or else he'd shoot. Chris ignored the warning. Vince shot and seriously injured Chris. Vince was charged with aggravated battery, which includes battery committed with a deadly weapon.

Can Vince successfully assert defense of property to justify the shooting?

A. No, because Vince was negligent in leaving the car running.
B. No, because Vince used deadly force.
C. Yes, because Vince warned Chris before using force against him.
D. Yes, because Vince reasonably believed that Chris was going to steal the car.
