You're a...... CROOK Captain Hook

On a dark and stormy night, a tanker sailing on the Ohio River ran into a large underwater pipe. The pipe burst and sent millions of gallons of toxic chemicals into the water. Louisville sued the ship in federal court, claiming severe damage to its historic riverfront.

Does the federal court have jurisdiction over the matter?

A. Yes, because the case has a maritime nexus.
B. Yes, because the case involves interstate commerce.
C. No, because Louisville is claiming damage to its riverbank.
D. No, because the accident did not occur at sea.
