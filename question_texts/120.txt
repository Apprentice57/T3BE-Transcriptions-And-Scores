OA265: The Investigation is Over, But the Investigations Continue (feat. Randall Eliason)

A bus passenger was seated next to a woman whom he did not know. The woman stood to exit the bus, leaving a package on the seat. The passenger lightly tapped the woman on the back to get her attention and to inform her that she had forgotten the package. Because the woman had recently had back surgery, the tap was painful and caused her to twist and seriously injure her back.

If the woman sues the passenger to recover for the back injury, will she be likely to prevail?

A. No, because she is presumed to have consented to the ordinary contacts of daily life.
B. No, because she was not put in apprehension by the touching.
C. Yes, because the passenger intentionally touched her.
D. Yes, because the passenger's intentional touching seriously injured her.
