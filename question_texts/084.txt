OA191: Fact and Fiction About Brett Kavanaugh

A defendant has pleaded not guilty to a federal bank robbery charge. The principal issue at trial is the identity of the robber. The prosecutor has called the defendant's wife to testify to the clothing that the defendant wore as he left their house on the day the bank was robbed, expecting her description to match that of eyewitnesses to the robbery. Both the defendant and his wife have objected to her testifying against the defendant.

Should the wife be required to testify?

A. No, because the defendant has a privilege to prevent his wife from testifying against him in a criminal case.
B. No, because the wife has a privilege not to testify against her husband in a criminal case,
C. Yes, because the spousal testimonial privilege does not apply in criminal cases.
D. Yes, because the wife's viewing of the defendantâ€™s clothing was not a confidential communication.
