OA118: Indictment Monday & the View From Yodel Mountain

Several persons together stole a painting from an art museum. One of them, who was the driver, was caught during the commission of another crime. He told the police, I didn't even get any money from that art museum. It all went to the first guy and the second guy.

When the first guy and the second guy go on trial for the theft of the art painting, is the driver's statement admissible in court?

A. Yes, as an admission by a party opponent.
B. Yes, as a statement against the interests of the other defendants.
C. No, because it was made while in custody and is therefore unreliable.
D. No, because the statement was not made in the course of or in furtherance of the conspiracy and thus it is hearsay.
