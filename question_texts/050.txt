OA122: Moore is Less

Cruiser and Flash were driving down Main Street in their distinctively painted, carefully restored old American automobiles, when Cruiser's vehicle bumped lightly into Flash's car, scraping away some paint. Cruiser and Flash both got out of their cars and examined the damage, after which Flash made some disparaging remarks about Cruiser's car. Cruiser slapped Flash in the face. Flash punched Cruiser in the nose. Cruiser seized Flash and a half Nelson and started to ram Flash's head into the side of Flash's car. At this moment, Flash's brother, Glitter, leaped from his car, pulled a knife, held it to Cruiser's throat saying, let him go or I'll cut you.

Cruiser released flash, but subsequently sued glitter for assault.

What is the result?

A. Cruiser wins because Glitter threatened him with deadly force.
B. Cruiser wins unless Ramming Flash's head into a car is considered a deadly attack.
C. Glitter wins because Cruiser started the fight by slapping Flash.
D. Glitter wins because he and Flash are relatives.
