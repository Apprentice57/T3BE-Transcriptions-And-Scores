OA306: From Gavin Grimm to Jeffrey Epstein

An uncle was the record title holder of a vacant tract of land. He often told friends that he would leave the land to his nephew in his will. The nephew knew of these conversations. Prior to the uncle's death, the nephew conveyed the land by warranty deed to a woman for $10,000. She did not conduct a title search of the land before she accepted the deed from the nephew. She promptly and properly recorded her deed. Last month, the uncle died, leaving the land to the nephew in his duly probated will. Both the nephew and the woman now claim ownership of the land. The nephew has offered to return the $10,000 to the woman.

Who has title to the land?

A. The nephew, because at the time of the deed to the woman, the uncle was the owner of record.
B. The nephew, because the woman did not conduct a title search.
C. The woman, because of the doctrine of estoppel by deed.
D. The woman, because she recorded her deed prior to the uncle's death.
