I Like My Bar Exam Questions Like I Like My Coffee

A group of people that hijacked a truck full of bees was arrested and indicted by a grand jury. During the grand jury's investigation, the district attorney's office subpoenaed the truck driver, Tom, as a witness. He was relieved that he was not asked questions about a series of thefts of shipments of bee boxes that he was involved in, but he worries the subject might be brought up a trial by the defense attorneys. Tom is afraid that he will be fired from his job if he invokes the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination on the witness stand, so he wants to avoid testifying at all at the trial, even if he is subpoenaed by the defense.

As Tom's lawyer, what advice would you give him about complying with a subpoena?

A. Tom can avoid testifying, because the potential that he will incriminate himself is greater than the interest the defense has in calling him as a witness.
B. Tom can avoid testifying, because he is not a party to the action.
C. Tom cannot avoid testifying, because he can plead the Fifth Amendment on the stand.
D. Tom cannot avoid testifying, because he must answer all questions truthfully, even if his answers will incriminate him, because he is not on trial.
