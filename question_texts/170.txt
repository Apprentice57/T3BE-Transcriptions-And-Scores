A man owned land. He took out a loan that was secured by a mortgage on the land. The man had personal liability on the loan.

The man sold the land to a purchaser, who expressly assumed the mortgage debt. The purchaser failed to make two installment payments. To prevent default and foreclosure, the man paid the overdue installments. After making the payments, the man sued the purchaser for reimbursement.

Will the man be likely to prevail?

A. No, because the man did not initiate foreclosure proceedings before seeking reimbursement.
B. No, because the man was personally liable on the loan.
C. Yes, because the law of suretyship permits the man to seek reimbursement.
D. Yes, because the man's transfer of the land discharged him from any personal liability on the loan.
