The Case of the Uneasy Easement - T3BE45

Thirty years ago, Orion owned a vast estate with many acres of rolling green hills, and gave an amusement park company an easement to build and operate, as well as maintain a go-kart track on his estate. The written easement was promptly and properly recorded, but the track was never laid. Fifteen years ago, Orion sold the land to Betty, a botanist. The deed of sale did not mention the easement. Recently, the amusement park company contacted Betty to let her know that it planned to install the go-kart track on its easement. There would be double the amount of go-karts than when easement was granted by the original owner, Orion. The amusement park company, which had since purchased an alternative energy company, also wanted to install several wind turbines on the same land covered by the easement. Betty has refused to allow the amusement park company to install the go-kart track and the wind turbines.

Can the amusement park company install the go-kart track and the wind turbines?

A. No as to both the go-kart track and the wind turbines.
B. No as to the go-kart track, but yes as to the wind turbines.
C. Yeas as to the go-kart track, but no as to the wind turbines.
D. Yes as to both the go-kart track and the wind turbines.
