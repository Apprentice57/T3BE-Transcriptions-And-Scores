Homeowner Homer contracted with local builder Bob to build a set of six raised beds in his backyard as Homer was an avid gardener. The agreement called for half of the contract price of $5,000 to be paid to Bob before he began work and the other half to be paid to him when the job was finished. Bob began the work but, partway through the job, he got an offer for another job that paid much better, and he quit abruptly.

Homer sues builder Bob for specific performance. Will Homer prevail?

A. Yes, because there has been a novation.
B. Yes, because the contract between the parties was valid and Bob had no legal justification for abruptly quitting.
C. No, because by not paying Bob for the second half of the job, Homer has not satisfied all of his conditions under the contract.
D. No, because the contract is for personal services.
