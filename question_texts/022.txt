OA66: Sanctuary Cities

At a yard sale, a seller puts out an old etching that he inherited from his aunt. He labels it with a price tag of $10. A buyer comes by, fully aware that it is the work of a famous Italian Renaissance artist, and quietly offers the $10 for an etching that he knows to be worth at least $100,000. When the seller finds out that he made an awful mistake and that the buyer knew it was a precious work of art, he sued to get the $100,000 or for return of the etching. The buyer defended by alleging that the seller did not act reasonably to protect himself by knowing what he was selling.

Under the restatement of contracts and the majority rule in case law, will the court grant the buyers motion to dismiss the seller's complaint?

A. Yes, the seller should have had the items appraised before selling them. The seller always must know the value of what is being offered for sale.
B. Yes, the seller cannot rescind a contract just because he later regrets it. Either party may end up with a superior deal depending on luck, knowledge, and a variety of factors.
C. No, because in some unilateral mistakes, rescission is allowed if there had been an unconscionably unequal exchange of values and there is no substantial hardship to the other party.
D. No, because a party always has a right to rescind a contract where the value of the product or services does not live up to his reasonable expectation.
