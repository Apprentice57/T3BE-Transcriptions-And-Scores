OA422: Road to Sedition aka Bill Barr, Evil POS

A man and a woman, both purse snatchers, independently entered a grocery store, each with the intent to steal purses from unsuspecting shoppers.

The man approached a victim, grabbed the strap of the purse that was hanging from her shoulder, and pulled. The victim screamed and tried to hold on to the purse, but the man knocked her down, causing her to lose her grip on the purse. The man then escaped with the purse.

During the commotion that arose when the man's victim screamed, the woman approached the shopping cart of a shopper who had turned toward the noise and wandered away from her cart. The woman reached into the now-unattended shopping cart, grabbed the shopper's purse, and quickly walked away, also escaping with a purse. Both purse snatchers were apprehended a short while later.

Which of the two purse snatchers could properly be convicted of robbery?

A. Both the man and the woman.
B. Only the man.
C. Only the woman.
D. Neither the man nor the woman.
