OA428: Govt. Caught Lying for Flynn

A plaintiff, who had been injured in an automobile collision, sued for damages. The defendant denied negligence and denied that the plaintiff's injuries were severe, At trial, the plaintiff has offered in evidence a color photograph of himself made from a videotape taken by a television news crew at the scene of the collision. The plaintiff has demonstrated that the videotape has since been routinely reused by the television station and that the footage of the plaintiff was erased. The photograph shows the plaintiff moments after the collision, with his bloodied head protruding at a grotesque angle through the broken windshield of his car.

Should the photograph be admitted over the defendant's objection?

A. No, because the plaintiff has failed to establish that a duplicate could not be found.
B. No, because the plaintiff has failed to produce the original videotape or a duplicate.
C. Yes, because it tends to prove a controverted fact.
D. Yes, because a photograph that establishes a disputed fact cannot be excluded as prejudicial.
