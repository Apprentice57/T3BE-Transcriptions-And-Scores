OA554: 6th Circuit Overrules Atrocious 5th Circuit Ruling on Vax Mandates

A defendant is prosecuted for battery after being involved in a fight at a sporting event. We'll say hockey. The defendant claims that the victim started the fight and that the defendant was acting in self-defense. At trial, the defendant called a witness that testified that the victim had a reputation for being belligerent and occasionally violent. The prosecution wishes to respond by calling its own witness that will testify that the defendant is known for his own hot temper and is feared in the community for getting violent over the smallest things.

Is the prosecution's action proper?

A. Yes, because when a victim's character is attacked, the prosecution can rebut with evidence of the victim's same character trait.
B. Yes, because when a defendant claims self-defense, he automatically places his or her character for violence in issue.
C. No, because the defendant never opened the door by placing his character for violence in the show. Or
D. No, because the prosecutor is limited to introducing evidence regarding the victim's character that contradicts the defendant's evidence.
