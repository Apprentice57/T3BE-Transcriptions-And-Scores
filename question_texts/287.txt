OA617: Alex Jones' Lawyers Have No F*cking Idea What They're Doing

In a civil battery case where the plaintiff was suing the defendant after the defendant allegedly tripped her while she was walking down the stairs, the plaintiff calls a witness to testify on her behalf. The witness corroborates the plaintiff's story.

Then, on cross-examination of the witness, counsel for the defendant asks, "Isn't it true that you cheated on your CPA exam last year by attempting to look at your notes during the test?" The plaintiff's counsel objects to the question.

How should the court rule on the objection?

A. It should be sustained because character cannot be proved by specific instances of conduct
B. It should be sustained because the question is irrelevant to the battery case
C. It should be overruled because the question regards the credibility of the witness
D. It should be overruled because it is permissible character evidence
