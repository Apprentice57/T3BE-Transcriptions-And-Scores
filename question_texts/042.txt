OA 106: Elections Have Consequences! Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders & the DNC Lawsuit

A man who was reportedly a renowned art thief, was on trial for stealing several Picasso's from a museum. The paintings had been recovered and were in the courtroom. The prosecution presented a professor of art history to authenticate each piece. The defense objected on the basis that the museum curator, where the paintings were housed, had to identify if these were in fact the paintings that were stolen.

Assuming that others will testify to the fact of the burglary is the court likely to reject this witness?

A. Yes, because artworks and other physical evidence must be authenticated by their official custodian.
B. Yes, because an outside person may be able to partially authenticate the painting, but he can't say whether it was the one that was in the museum or that was stolen.
C. No, granting the objection will simply waste the court's time if the court has to bring in the museum curator and go through hoops to authenticate the paintings.
D. No, because the authentication can be accomplished in several different ways that will verify it is the genuine piece of art in question.
