OA458: Biden's Amazing First Day

A woman sued a man for physical damages based on a federal statutory claim. The incident occurred within State A, but the woman brought suit in federal court. State A recognizes all of the privileges recognized at common law.

At trial, the man called the woman's treating physician to testify as to statements made in confidence to him by the woman in furtherance of medical treatment. The woman objects and claims that the physician-patient privilege applies to her statements.

Which law should the court apply to the claim of privilege?

A. The state law, and the court should therefore recognize the claim of privilege.
B. The federal law, and the court should therefore recognize the claim of privilege.
C. The state law, and the court should therefore reject the claim of privilege.
D. The federal law, and the court should therefore reject the claim of privilege.
