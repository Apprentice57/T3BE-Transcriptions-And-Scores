OA231: The End of the Beginning (for Trump)

A purchaser bought land in the mountain foothills just outside a resort town and planned to build a housing development there. Soon thereafter, the county in which the land was located unexpectedly adopted a regulation that, for the first time, prohibited all construction in several foothill and mountain areas, including the area of the purchaser's property. The purpose of the county's regulation was "to conserve for future generations the unique natural wildlife and plant habitats" in the mountain areas. Since the adoption of the regulation, the purchaser has been unable to lease or sell the property at any price. Several Realtors have advised the purchaser that the property is now worthless. The purchaser has sued the county, claiming that the regulation has effected a taking of the purchaser’s property and that the county therefore owes the purchaser just compensation.

Is the court likely to rule in favor of the purchaser?

A. No, because the county did not take title to the property from the purchaser.
B. No, because the regulation has not caused or authorized any uninvited physical invasion or intrusion onto the property.
C. Yes, because the conservation objective of the county ordinance is not sufficiently compelling to justify the substantial diminution in the property value.
D. Yes, because the effect of the county’s regulation is to deny the purchaser's investment-backed expectation and essentially all economically beneficial use of the property.
