OA328: The Impeachment Inquiry Resolution! (H.R. 660)

A landowner orally gave his neighbor permission to share the use of a private road on the landowner's land so that the neighbor could have more convenient access to the neighbor's land. Only the landowner maintained the road. After the neighbor had used the road on a daily basis for three years, the landowner conveyed his land to a grantee, who immediately notified the neighbor that the neighbor was not to use the road. The neighbor sued the grantee, seeking a declaration that the neighbor had a right to continue to use the road.

Who is likely to prevail?

A. The grantee, because an oral license is invalid,
B. The grantee, because the neighbor had a license that the grantee could terminate at any time.
C. The neighbor, because the grantee is estopped from terminating the neighbor's use of the road.
D. The neighbor. because the neighbor's use of the road was open and notorious when the grantee purchased the land.
