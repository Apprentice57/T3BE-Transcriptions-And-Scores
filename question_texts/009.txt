OA40: Who is Neil Gorsuch, and How Scared Should You Be?

Two cousins took title to real estate as joint tenants. The first cousin put up his interest in the joint tenancy as security for a $20,000 loan and signed a judgment note. It was later entered as a judgment against that cousin's interest in the real estate. The first cousin then died a year later. The second cousin defended on the basis that any lien on the first cousin's interest in the property was extinguished on the first cousin's death.

Will the court enforce the lien of the mortgagee against the sale of the property by the second cousin?

A. Yes, because the second cousin's assent to the judgment lien was presumed by law.
B. Yes, because the joint tenancy was broken when the first cousin put the judgment lien on the property.
C. No, because the judgment lien was never valid. A joint tenant cannot file a judgment note on just that joint tenant's interest. Or
D. No, because when the first cousin died, the second cousin became the sole owner due to the right of survivorship, as per the joint tenancy, which was still fully intact.
