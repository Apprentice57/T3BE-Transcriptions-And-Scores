OA110: Gun Control After Las Vegas & Two Trips To Yodel Mountain

A female employee was fired as an executive assistant at the time when she was seven months pregnant. She brought a Title VII civil rights action in federal court for gender discrimination against the employer. At trial, a former co-worker of the woman was not allowed to testify that she heard the human relations manager saying in an informal meeting that the plaintiff and her predecessor were both fired due to what the manager described as, "pregnancy complications". The proposed witness had been a vice president of the company and a close advisor to the president. Without the benefit of that vital testimony, the jury entered a verdict for the defendant employer. On appeal, the plaintiff argued that the testimony should have been allowed and that it was not hearsay under the federal rules.

Will the court likely grant the appeal and order a new trial?

A. No, because the statement is clearly hearsay with no exception to the hearsay rule being applicable.
B. No, because it was based on things the coworker heard from others, making it double hearsay that is never admissible.
C. Yes, because that kind of testimony is reliable and not excludable as hearsay.
D. Yes, because it was admissible under the spontaneous utterance exception to the hearsay rules.
