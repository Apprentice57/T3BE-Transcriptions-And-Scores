OA308: Faithless Electors

A customer fell and injured himself when he slipped on a banana peel while shopping at a grocery store. The banana peel was fresh and unblemished except for a mark made by the heel of the customer's shoe. In an action brought by the customer against the store, these are the only facts in evidence.

Should the trial judge permit the case to go to the jury?

A. No, because the customer had an obligation to watch where he stepped.
B. No, because there is not a reasonable basis for inferring that the store knew or should have known of the banana peel.
C. Yes, because it is more likely than not that the peel came from a banana offered for sale by the grocer,
D. Yes, because the store could foresee that a customer might slip on a banana peel.
