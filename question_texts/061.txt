OA144: Our Football-Free Superb Owl Edition

John and Mary were camping just south of a river in the National Forest when a forest fighter was ignited nearby by lightning. In order to avoid the flames, John swam across the river and untied a canoe from a no trespassing sign. One of many were stuck in the riverbank about every 100 feet.

In his haste, John destroyed the sign in freeing the canoe. John paddled the canoe back across the river to get buried. John and Mary headed west, hoping to find a public road. Ogre, the owner of the property, was out practicing his bow hunting skills when he saw the couple and assumed they were intending to camp on his land. An accomplished woodsman, Ogre trailed them. Intending to frighten them so that they would leave and not return, Ogre shot an arrow so that it would pass in front of the two campers and "thwack!" into the tree just before they walked by. At the moment of release, however, another lightning strike occurred very close by, startling Ogre so that his arrow passed closer than he had intended, narrowly missing Mary and hitting and cutting John's hand.

Can Mary recover against Ogre for assault?

A. No, because she was not touched by the arrow.
B. No, because Ogre believed she was a trespasser.
C. Yes, because Ogre used excessive force.
D. Yes, since Mary must have seen the arrow pass in front of her.
