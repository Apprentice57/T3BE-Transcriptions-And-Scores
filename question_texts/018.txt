OA58: What Football Can Teach Us About Jury Nullification, Antitrust, and Donald Trump - Part 2

The United States Congress passed, and the president signed a law called the American Morality Leadership Act, which limits the amount of makeup that women can wear in public and precludes the wearing of short dresses. Men over 65 must wear only brown or gray attire, while those under 65 must wear button-down dress shirts with neckties, except for when they are exercising or working physically. The Act has other restrictions and specifications for dress and grooming mandates for men and women. A class action is filed to challenge the constitutionality of the Act.

Which argument listed below more closely reflects the constitutional argument that is most likely to succeed in court?

A. The law is unconstitutional because it violates the Commerce Clause.
B. The law is unconstitutional because it denies all citizens the equal protection of the law.
C. The law is unconstitutional because it violates procedural due process.
D. The law is unconstitutional because it is not rationally related to a legitimate government interest.
