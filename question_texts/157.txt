OA341: Articles of Impeachment (& Espionza)

Before putting her home up for sale, a homeowner painted the living room ceiling to conceal major water damage caused by a leaking roof that had not yet been repaired. On the first day the home was offered for sale, the homeowner gave a buyer a personal tour. The homeowner made no statements at all regarding the water damage or the roof. Without discovering the water damage or the leaking roof and without consulting a lawyer, the buyer immediately agreed in writing to buy the home for $200,000.

Before the closing date, the buyer discovered the water damage and the leaking roof. The cost of repair was estimated at $22,000. The buyer has refused to go through with the purchase. If the homeowner sues the buyer for breach of contract, is the homeowner likely to prevail?

A. No, because no contract was formed since the buyer did not have a real opportunity to understand the essential terms of the contract.
B. No, because the homeowner concealed evidence of the water damage and of the leaking roof.
C. Yes, because the homeowner made no affirmative statements of fact about the water damage or the leaking roof.
D. Yes, because the buyer acted unreasonably by failing to employ an inspector to conduct an independent inspection of the home.
