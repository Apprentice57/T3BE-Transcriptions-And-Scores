OA426: Breonna Updates; Trump's Outrageous Tax Returns

A recently enacted federal statute requires the President to make each appointment of a United States ambassador to a foreign country from a list of three individuals. The list is to be compiled by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and approved by the full Senate in advance of the appointment. The statute also provides that Senate confirmation of the appointment is deemed to occur automatically 30 days after the time the President names an appointee from the list, unless the full Senate determines otherwise within the 30-day period.

Is this statute constitutional?

A. No, because the statute violates the constitutional requirements for appointment of principal officers of the United States.
B. No, because the statute impermissibly restricts the plenary foreign affairs powers of the President.
C. Yes, because the statute is consistent with the constitutional requirement that the presidential appointment of ambassadors be with the advice and consent of the Senate.
D. Yes, because the statute is a necessary and proper measure in furtherance of Congress's power to regulate commerce with foreign states.
