OA601: SCOTUS Ruling Guarantees More Innocent Will Be Put to Death

A restaurant headquartered in state a was the subject of multiple premises, liability suits, stemming from a spill on the floor that caused multiple injuries.

Plaintiff 1 sued the restaurant in state court located in state A for negligence. In that suit, it was determined after a full litigation that the employees of the corporation were aware of the spill on the floor and did have a duty to warn the plaintiff of the spill. Following a full trial, plaintiff 1 succeeded in her suit against the restaurant. The restaurant filed an appeal and that appeal is still pending. Plaintiff 2 filed suit against the restaurant in federal court located in state B. Plaintiff 2 sought to preclude the restaurant from asserting that it did not owe a duty to warn of the spill under collateral estoppel. The law of State A allows for the use of offensive non-mutual collateral estoppel.

The law of State B prohibits the use of offensive non-mutual collateral estoppel. Federal law allows for the use of collateral estoppel as justice permits. The law in all three jurisdictions states that a judgment is final until reversed or otherwise modified assumed jurisdiction and venue are proper.

What should the court do?

A. Allow the restaurant to litigate the issue of its duty to warn, because the federal court will apply the law of the state in which it sits.
B. Evaluate whether justice would allow the use of non-mutual collateral estoppel because the federal law will apply its own law on procedural issues.
C. Prohibit the restaurant from litigating the issue of its duty to warn because the federal court will apply the law of state A.
D. Delay the case until the appeal is decided.
