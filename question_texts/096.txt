OA215: Is Gamble v US the Real Reason Behind Kavanaugh?

A bakery offered a chef a permanent full-time job as a pastry chef at a salary of $3,000 per month. The chef agreed to take the position and to begin work in two weeks. In her employment application, the chef had indicated that she was seeking Permanent job. One week after the chef was hired by the bakery, a hotel offered the chef a position as a restaurant manager at a salary of $3,500 a month. The chef accepted and promptly notified the bakery that she would not report for work at the bakery.

Is the bakery likely to prevail in a lawsuit against the chef for breach of contract?

A. No, because a contract for permanent employment would be interpreted to mean that the chef could leave at any time,
B. No, because the position the chef took with the hotel was not substantially comparable to the one she had agreed to take with the bakery.
C. Yes, because the chef's acceptance of a permanent position meant that she agreed to leave the bakery only after a reasonable time.
D. Yes, because the chef's failure to give the bakery a chance to match the salary offered by the hotel breached the implied right of first refusal.
