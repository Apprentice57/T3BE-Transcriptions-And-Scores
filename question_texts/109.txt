OA243: Build That Wall!

A seller and a purchaser signed a contract for the sale of a 60-year-old house. The contract required a warranty deed to be given at closing. The contract was silent regarding the condition of the house, and the purchaser did not ask. The purchaser received a warranty deed with all covenants of title at the closing and promptly recorded the deed. Approximately one month after the closing, the furnace in the house stopped working, the basement flooded, and the roof leaked so badly that the second floor could not be occupied. The seller, when told of the house's condition, was genuinely surprised.

There is no applicable statute.

A. Yes, because a conveyance of residential real property, a warranty of fitness is implied.
B. Yes, based on the covenants of title contained in the deed the purchaser received.
C. No, because the seller gave no warranty regarding the condition of the house.
