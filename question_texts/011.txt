OA44: All About Arbitration

A patient who had surgery to repair a rupture in her spleen followed up with a full body MRI due to the excruciating pain that had developed. During the MRI, the technician saw at least two identifiable sponges that had been left in her body. The patient sued the hospital and the doctor for medical malpractice. She did not produce the printouts of the MRI. Instead, she attempted to testify as to what she observed on the MRI scan. The defense objected and insisted that she must produce the actual MRI printouts.

What is the most likely ruling of the trial judge with respect to the objection?

A. She does not have to produce the MRI scan because a layperson can testify to things of common knowledge, such as what a sponge looks like.
B. She does have to produce the MRI scan because a layperson cannot testify as to personal observations.
C. She does not have to produce the MRI scan because she can testify as to the content of her own medical records.
D. She must produce the MRI records because it represents the best evidence under the best evidence rule.
