OA160: Schrodinger's Andrew

A driver returning home from a long work shift at a factory fell asleep at the wheel and lost control of his car. As a result, his car collided with a police car being driven by an officer who was returning to the station after having responded to an emergency. The officer was injured in the accident and later sued the driver in negligence for her injuries. The driver has moved for summary judgment, arguing that the common law firefighters rule bars the suit.

Should the court grant the motion?

A. No, because the firefighters rule does not apply to police officers.
B. No, because the police officer's injuries were not related to any special dangers of her job.
C. Yes, because the accident would not have occurred but for the emergency.
D. Yes, because the police officer was injured on the job.
