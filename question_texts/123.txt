OA273: Sears, Steve Mnuchin & "The Producers"

A seller entered into written contract to sell a tract of land to an investor. The contract made no mention of the quality of title to be conveyed. The seller and the investor later completed the sale, and the seller delivered a warranty deed to the investor. Soon thereafter, the value of the land increased dramatically. The investor entered into a written contract to sell the land to a buyer. The contract between the investor and the buyer expressly provided that the investor would convey a marketable title. The buyer's attorney discovered that the tile of the land was not marketable and had not been marketable when the original seller had conveyed to the investor. The buyer refused to complete the sale. The investor sued the original seller for breach of contact, claiming damages from the seller's failure to convey marketable title, which resulted in the investor's loss of the sale to the subsequent buyer.

Who is likely to prevail on this count?

A. The investor, because the law implies in such a contract a covenant that the title will be marketable.
B. The investor, because the original seller is liable for all reasonably foreseeable damages.
C. The original seller, because her contract obligations as to title merged into the deed.
D. The original seller, because she did not expressly agree to convey marketable title.
