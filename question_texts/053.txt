OA128: Antitrust, Part Two

During the course of his trial for assault, Danny placed professional sociologist Sato on the stand. Sato testified that he had scientifically pulled the community in which Danny lived and that Danny had a high reputation for being a peaceable man in a rather rough community. On cross-examination, the prosecutor asks Sato: "isn't it true, Mr. Sato, that last year you filed a false income tax return"? The defense immediately objected.

Should the court require Sato to answer the question posed to him?

A. Yes, but only if Sato has been convicted of filing a false tax return.
B. Yes, because the question is relevant to the truthfulness and credibility of the witness.
C. No, because specific instances of conduct are inadmissible.
D. No, because the question does not go to a relevant character trait.
