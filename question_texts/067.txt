OA156: Conor Lamb & Pennsylvania Recounts

Nine gang members, including the gang leader, were indicted for the murder of a 10th gang member who had become an informant. The gang leader pleaded guilty. At the trial of the other eight gang members, the state's evidence showed the following:

The gang leader had announced a party to celebrate the release of a gang member from jail, but the party was not what it seemed. The gang leader had learned that the released gang member had earned his freedom by informing the authorities about the gang's criminal activities. The gang leader decided to use the party to let other gang members see what happened to informants. He told no one about his plan. At the party, after everyone had consumed large amounts of alcohol, the gang leader announced that the released gang member was an informant and stabbed him with a knife in front of the others. The other eight gang members watched and did nothing, while the released gang member bled slowly to death.

The jury found the eight gang members guilty of murder, and they appealed. Should the appellate court uphold the convictions?

A. No, because the mere presence at the scene of a crime is insufficient to make a person an accomplice.
B. No, because murder is a specific intent crime and there is insufficient evidence to show that the other gang members intended to kill.
C. Yes, because the gang members made no effort to save the released gang member after he had been stabbed.
D. Yes, because voluntary intoxication does not negate criminal responsibility.
