OA187: Lowering the Lukumi Bar?

Police officers received a tip that illegal drugs were being sold at a certain ground-floor apartment. They decided to stake out the apartment. The stakeout revealed that a significant number of people visited the apartment for short periods of time and then left. A man exited the apartment and started to walk briskly away. The officers grabbed the man and, when he struggled, wrestled him to the ground. They searched him and found a bag of heroin in one of his pockets. After discovering the heroin on the man, the officers decided to enter the apartment. They knocked on the door, which was opened by the woman who lived there. The officers asked if they could come inside, and the woman gave them permission to do so. Once inside, the officers observed several bags of heroin on the living room table.

The woman has been charged with possession of the heroin found on the living room table. She has filed a pretrial motion to suppress the heroin on the ground that it was obtained by an illegal search and seizure.

Should the woman’s motion be granted?

A. No, because the tip together with the heroin found in the man’s pocket provided probable cause for the search.
B. No, because the woman consented to the officers’ entry.
C. Yes, because the officers’ decision to enter the apartment was the fruit of an illegal search of the man.
D. Yes, because the officers did not inform the woman that she could refuse consent.
