OA514: I Love It When A Plan Comes Together

A wholesaler brought a federal diversity action against a large pharmaceutical company for breach of contract. During jury selection, one potential juror stated that five years earlier he had been an employee of the company and still owned several hundred shares of its stock. In response to questioning from the judge, the potential juror stated that he could fairly consider the evidence in the case.

The wholesaler’s attorney has asked the judge to strike the potential juror for cause.

Should the judge strike the potential juror for cause?

A. No, because the potential juror said that he could fairly consider the evidence in the case.
B. No, because the wholesaler’s attorney could use a peremptory challenge to strike the potential juror.
C. Yes, because other potential jurors still remain available for the jury panel.
D. Yes, because the potential juror is presumed to be biased because of his relationship to the company.
