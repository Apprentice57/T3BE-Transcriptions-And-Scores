A host pointed an unloaded revolver at her guest, threatening to shoot him. The guest knew that the revolver was not loaded, and that the ammunition for the revolver was stored in a locked basement closet, two stories below where the two were then standing.

In an action brought by the guest against the host for assault, will the guest be likely to prevail?

A. No, because the host did not intend to shoot her guest.
B. No, because the host did not put her guest in apprehension of an imminent contact.
C. Yes, because the ammunition was accessible to the host.
D. Yes, because the host threatened her guest with a revolver.
