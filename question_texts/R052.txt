Pete Hegseth Is Finally Going to Make the US Military Less Woke

Police officer Paul had probable cause to believe that defendant Delilah was involved in the sale of illegal drugs. Paul obtained a valid arrest warrant and went to Delilah's home to execute it. The officer decided to go to Delilah's home right when he thought she would return from work so he could search the house before Delilah had a chance to hide the drugs. When Paul arrived at the defendant's home, the door was ajar, but nothing seemed out of the ordinary. Paul slowly opened the door and entered the home. The officer walked toward the back of the house and when he heard Delilah in a bedroom, he pushed open the door, loudly told her to freeze, and arrested her.

Did the officer properly execute the arrest warrant?

A. No, because Paul had no consent to enter Delilah's home.
B. No, because Paul failed to "knock and announce" his presence before entering Delilah's house.
C. Yes, because Paul obtained a valid arrest warrant, which gives Paul the right to arrest Delilah in her home.
D. Yes, because Paul went to Delilah's home when he had a reasonable belief that Delilah would be there.
