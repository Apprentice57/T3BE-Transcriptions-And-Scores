OA414: Steve Bannon Arrested!

A state law that restricted abortion was challenged in state court as a violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and as a violation of a similar due process provision of the state constitution. The ease made its way to the state's highest court, which riled that the law violated the due process provisions of both the U.S. and the state constitutions.

If petitioned to do so, may the U.S. Supreme Court exercise jurisdiction to review the state court decision?

A. No, because the state court's decision in this case rests on adequate and independent state law grounds.
B. No, because the U.S. Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction only over state court decisions that determine the constitutionality of federal laws.
C. Yes, because the U.S. Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction over any ruling of a state's highest court based on an interpretation of federal law.
D. Yes, because the U.S, Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction over decisions that find state laws in violation of the federal Constitution.
