OA420: DoJ Defending Trump in Carroll Case?

An actor straight out of drama school and an agent entered into a one-year written contract that described the services the agent would provide. Because he was eager for work, the actor agreed, in the contract, to pay the agent 15% of his yearly earnings. At the end of the year, the actor was so pleased with his many roles that he gave the agent 20% of his earnings. After the first contract had expired, the actor and the agent decided to continue working together. They photocopied their old contract, changed the date, and signed it. At the end of the year, a dispute arose as to what percentage of earnings the actor owed. It is a trade practice in the acting profession for actors to pay their agents 10% of their yearly earnings, payable at the end of the year.

What percentage of the actor's earnings is a court most likely to award the agent?

A. 20%, because course of dealing is given greater weight than trade usage.
B. 15%, because it was an express term of the contract.
C. 10%, because trade usage is the applicable default rule.
D. Nothing, because the contract is too indefinite.
