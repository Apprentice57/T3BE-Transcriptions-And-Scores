OA176: It's Summer (Zervos) Time!

A state legislature passed a statute providing that juries in criminal trials were to consist of 6 jurors, rather than 12, and that jury verdicts did not have to be unanimous but could be based on 5 votes out of 6 jurors.

A defendant was tried for murder. Over his objection, he was tried by a jury composed of 6 jurors. The jurors found him guilty by a vote of 5 to 1, and over the defendant's objection, the court entered a judgment of conviction, which was affirmed on appeal by the stateâ€™s highest court.

The defendant seeks to overturn his conviction in a habeas corpus proceeding in federal court, claiming that the trial court violated his constitutional rights by allowing both a non-unanimous jury verdict and a jury composed of fewer than 12 members.

How is the federal court likely to rule in this action?

A. It will set aside the conviction, because the jury was composed of fewer than 12 members.
B. It will set aside the conviction, because the 6-person jury verdict was not unanimous.
C. It will set aside the conviction, both because the jury was composed of fewer than 12 members and because the 6-person jury verdict was not unanimous.
D. It will uphold the conviction.
