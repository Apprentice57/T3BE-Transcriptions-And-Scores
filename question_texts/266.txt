OA570: Sandy Hook Families Win Major Settlement

An attorney represented a client who was the plaintiff in a personal injury action. After the action had settled, the attorney received a check in the amount of $10,000 payable to the attorney, which she deposited in her client trust account. The next day, the attorney received a letter from a bank. The bank informed the attorney that the client had failed to make mortgage payments on a residential building for the last three months and demanded that the attorney immediately release $3,000 of the settlement proceeds to the bank to avert immediate foreclosure proceedings against the client. When the attorney, who did not represent the client in the mortgage matter, informed the client of the bankâ€™s letter, the client did not dispute the $3,000 debt but expressed no concern for what the bank might do. The client believed that the building was essentially worthless, so he assumed that the bank would never foreclose. The client instructed the attorney to take her legal fees from the settlement and turn the rest of the proceeds over to him. The attorney followed the client's instructions.

Is the attorney subject to discipline?

A. Yes, because the client did not dispute the $3,000 debt to the bank.
B. Yes, because the attorney knew that the client was planning to force the bank to foreclose the mortgage.
C. No, because the attorney did not represent the client in the mortgage matter.
D. No, because the bank had no established right to the specific proceeds of the client's personal injury settlement.
