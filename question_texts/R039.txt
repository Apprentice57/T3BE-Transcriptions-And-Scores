OA Bar Prep With Heather! T3BE39

Dante was a clerk working at Quick Stop, a small convenience store in New Jersey, when Randall came up to the counter to buy a six-pack of beer. Dante thought Randall did not look old enough to purchase the beer, so he asked for his driver's license. Randall acted like he was going to grab his wallet as Dante turned around to grab a bag for the beer. When Dante's back was turned, Randall threw money on the counter, grabbed the beer, and ran out of the Quick Stop.

A. Dante asked for Randall's driver's license.
