OA318: Quid Pro Quo Burger

A seller and a buyer entered into a contract obligating the seller to convey title to a parcel of land to the buyer in exchange for $100,000. The agreement provided that the buyer's obligation to purchase the parcel was expressly conditioned upon the buyer's obtaining a loan at an interest rate no higher than 10%. The buyer was unable to do so but did obtain a loan at an interest rate of 10.5% and timely tendered the purchase price. Because the value of the land had increased since the time of contracting, the seller refused to perform. The buyer sued the seller.

Is the buyer likely to prevail?

A. No, because an express condition will be excused only to avoid forfeiture.
B. No, because the contract called for a loan at an interest rate not to exceed 10% and it could not be modified without the consent of the seller.
C. Yes, because the buyer detrimentally changed position in reliance on the seller's promise to convey.
D. Yes, because the buyer's obtaining a loan at an interest rate no higher than 10% was not a condition to the seller's duty to perform.
