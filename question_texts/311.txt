OA676: Kel McClanahan on the Biden Docs

City college is funded by the county government of state X.

City college issues an email directive that all employees disclose all social club memberships at the start of every school year.

The purpose of the directive is unclear. Most employees make the disclosure for fear of losing their jobs, but a college accountant challenges the directive as non-mandatory.

Can the college accountant call one of her fellow employees to testify that the directive was distributed only by email?

A. No because email is not a proper forum for college instruction.
B. Yes because it is relevant.
C. Yes because it is relevant to the issue of state action.
D. Yes because it is relevant to whether it was advisory or mandatory.
