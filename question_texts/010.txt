OA42: Denny Hastert and the Limits of Contract Law

A college student files a criminal case against his former roommate, claiming that the former roommate snuck in and removed his state-of-the-art home theater equipment from his house. The college student took the approved prosecution papers and filed them with a magistrate court. An ongoing police investigation determined, however, that the college student was a vengeful person, not averse to creating stories, and that he and the former roommate had been arguing over a number of issues. They also determined that he never had any quality sound or video. The police decide to drop the prosecution. The case is dismissed at the preliminary hearing.

When the former roommate filed a civil case against the complainant for malicious prosecution, will the evidence of defendant's reputation for dishonesty be admissible?

A. Yes, because dishonesty at any time in the past is always relevant to a malicious prosecution complaint.
B. Yes, because even though character evidence is too collateral to be admitted for circumstantial evidence, it is admissible if it is directly at issue in the case.
C. Yes, because reputation evidence, just like most character evidence, is virtually always admissible.
D. Yes, because while most character evidence is not admissible, some is, and reputation evidence is always admissible.
