OA205: More on Masterpiece, Younger & the Catholic Church (w/guest Andrew Seidel)

Several public high school students asked the superintendent of their public school district whether the minister of a local church could deliver an interdenominational prayer at their graduation ceremony in the school auditorium, None of the students or their guests at graduation would be required to pray while the minister delivered the prayer.

Would the ministerâ€™s delivery of such a prayer at the public high school graduation be constitutional?

A. No, because it would be an unconstitutional establishment of religion.
B. No, because it would deny attendees who are not members of the minister's denomination the right to freely exercise their religion.
C. Yes, because none of the students or their guests would be required to pray at the graduation ceremony.
D. Yes, because the idea for the prayer originated with the students and not with school officials.
