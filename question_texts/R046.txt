Taking Jurisdiction Personally - T3BE 46

Don was married to Patty where they lived together in California for over a decade. Don grew tired of his marriage and moved to Florida where he filed for divorce, but did not serve process on Patty. Patty did not have any contacts with the state of Florida as she had never set foot there a day in her life.

During this divorce debacle, Patty's mother received a letter from *Big Envelope Winnings* that led her to believe she won a beautiful beachfront home in Florida and was required to travel there to claim it. Patty and her mom flew to Florida together despite Patty's belief that there was no home awaiting her mother on the shores of Florida's warm waters.

After landing in Florida, Patty's mom quickly learned that she had not won anything at all and *Big Envelope Winnings* was later shut down for sending letters fraudulently enticing people to come to Florida. However, while in Florida, Patty was served by her husband Don with a summons related to the Florida divorce proceedings.

If Patty argues that she is not subject to personal jurisdiction in Florida, will she prevail?

A. Yes, because her presence in Florida was procured by fraud.
B. Yes, because she did not have minimum contacts with Florida.
C. No, because Patty consented to personal jurisdiction in Florida.
D. No, because Patty was served while physically present in Florida.
