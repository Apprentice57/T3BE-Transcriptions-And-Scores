OA372: The CARES Act, COVID-19, and Your $1,200 Check

An experienced rancher contracted to harvest his neighbor's wheat crop for $1,000 "when the crop [was] ripe." In early September, the neighbor told the rancher that the crop was ripe. The rancher delayed because he had other customers to attend to. The neighbor was concerned that the delay might cause the crop to be lost, for hailstorms were common in that part of the country in the fall. In fact, in early October, before the crop was harvested, it was destroyed by a hailstorm.

Is the rancher liable for the loss?

A. No, because no time for performance was established in the contract.
B. No, because the neighbor failed to tell the rancher that the crop might be destroyed by a hailstorm.
C. Yes, because at the time the contract was made, the rancher had reason to foresee the loss as a probable result of is breach.
D. Yes, because a party who undertakes a contractual obligation is liable for all the consequences that flow from his breach.
