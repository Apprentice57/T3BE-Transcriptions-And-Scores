If a Chandelier Falls and You Aren't There to See It, Did the Liability Even Happen?

Winnie was on her way to meet her husband Herb for lunch at the restaurant adjacent to the bookstore where he worked. Winnie had just entered the building, which was owned and operated by the bookstore, when she heard the sound of breaking glass and screams. A big chandelier that was hanging in the restaurant fell into the waiting area. Winnie saw several injured people in the waiting area, including her husband, who was lying in the wreckage of the chandelier. When she saw her husband, Winnie fainted and hit her foot on an umbrella stand, breaking the bones in her foot. The chandelier fell because the fastener that the bookstore used to secure it to the ceiling was loose.

If Winnie sues the bookstore for her injury, is she likely to prevail?

A. Yes, because her husband was one of the people she saw lying in the wreckage.
B. Yes, because the bookstore used the fastener for the chandelier.
C. No, because she was not personally in the zone of danger of physical injury.
D. No, because she did not actually see the chandelier collapse onto the diners.
