OA74: Sippin’ #Covfefe With Trump’s Severed Head

A purse snatcher ran up to a woman grabbed her purse and ran off there was a witness at the scene the witness worked with the police a few days later to try and create a composite sketch of the purse snatcher boy that is a tough word to say. This was used by the police to capture the purported purse stature. The witness died several days before the trial.

When the witness's drawing was offered by the prosecution as evidence at trial, is the trial judge likely to accept it as admissible evidence?

A. Yes, because the police took it and used it to find someone. Therefore, it must be an accurate representation of the perpetrator. The exhibit must be admitted.
B. Yes, because it is in the nature of the written recollection of the decedent, at a time close to the crime, and therefore has testimonial reliability.
C. No, because the defense has had no opportunity to cross-examine the witness under oath about the drawing prior to her death, and such sketches are inherently unreliable in any event.
D. No, because it was drawn up days after the event and is in violation of the best evidence rule.
