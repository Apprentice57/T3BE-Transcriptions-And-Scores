OA382: Bernie Sanders Was Right! (The DNC & Payday Lenders)

A protester entered an IRS office during business hours. He denounced the income tax and set fire to pages from his copy of the Internal Revenue Code. The fire was extinguished before it caused any other damage. The protester was arrested and charged with,
violating a state law that prohibited igniting a fire in a public building. He claimed that his prosecution was unconstitutional under the First Amendment.

May the protester constitutionally be convicted?

A. because he was exercising his right to freedom of speech by burning a copy of the code.
B. No, because the copy of the code belonged to him, and thus burning it did not infringe upon a legitimate government interest.
C. Yes, because the burning of the code was conduct rather than speech.
D. Yes, because the state law is narrowly drawn to further a substantial government interest in prohibiting the noncommunicative aspects of the act in question.
