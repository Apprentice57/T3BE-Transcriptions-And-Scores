OA672: How Conservative Courts Rewrite History

City college is funded by the county government of state X.

City college issues an email directive that all employees disclose all social club memberships at the start of every school year.

The purpose of the directive is unclear. Most employees make the disclosure for fear of losing their jobs, but a college accountant challenges the directive as unconstitutional.

Is the college accountant correct?

A. The college accountant is probably wrong - such memberships exist
B. The directive is probably wrong - social club memberships are a private right.
C. No. The directive is probably constitutional as long as there is a connection to job performance.
D. Yes. The directive is probably constitutional if there is a proven state action and it is wrongful.
