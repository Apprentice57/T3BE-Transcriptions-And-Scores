OA562: Supreme Court Rules Against Trump; Interview with Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi

A state prosecutor was assigned to a murder case in which the defendant had confessed to committing the crime. In the same confession, the defendant had also confessed to committing many other crimes over many years, including the murder of a young woman in another jurisdiction. In investigating the defendant's confession, which the prosecutor knew to be credible, the prosecutor discovered that another individual had been convicted and sentenced to prison for the murder of the young woman. Based on the defendant's confession, for which there was corroboration, the prosecutor knew that it was reasonably likely that the individual convicted of murdering the young woman was innocent. The prosecutor did not tell anyone about the defendant's confession to the murder of the young woman.

Was the prosecutor's conduct proper?

A. No, because the prosecutor failed to promptly disclose the information regarding the defendant's confession to a court or the chief prosecutor in the other jurisdiction.
B. No, because the prosecutor failed to investigate to determine whether the individual convicted of murdering the young woman was innocent.
C. Yes, because the defendant's confession was information relating to the prosecutor's representation of the state.
D. Yes, because the prosecution of the other individual for murdering the young woman was final.
