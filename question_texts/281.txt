OA605: GEICO to Pay $5.2m for Car Sex?! and MORE Jan 6 Bombshells!

A soccer player brought a battery action against a player on the opposing soccer team. The soccer player presented evidence that the opposing player kicked the soccer player in the shin when the soccer player was trying to score a goal. The opposing player presented evidence that he was merely trying to get the ball from the soccer player and the kick to the shin was an accident. Further, the opposing player testified that the game was "played rough" in their city, and the soccer player consented to being kicked regardless. The opposing player also presented a witness who testified that several players are injured over the course of a typical soccer game in that city and that games have been played that way for several years in that particular area. The soccer player did not cross-examine the witness.

After resting its case, the opposing player moved for judgment as a matter of law. Should the court grant the motion?

A. Yes, because the soccer player did not cross-examine the witness who testified regarding custom in the city.
B. Yes, because the judge can, as a matter of law, decide cases when the judge believes the evidence substantially favors one party.
C. No, because whether the kick was an accident and whether the soccer player consented to it are questions of fact for the jury.
D. No, because a motion for judgment as a matter of law must first be made at the close of the plaintiff's case-in-chief rather than for the first time at the end of trial.
