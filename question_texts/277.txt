OA597: 5th Circuit Tells SCOTUS Hold My Beer

A 16-year-old boy was operating a motor boat. While operating the motor boat, the boy got distracted by text messages from his friend, and the boy inadvertently struck a woman sitting in a canoe in his path. The boy did not know the woman was there. The woman suffered serious injuries and sued the boy for battery.

Will the woman succeed?

A. Yes, if the trier of fact finds that a boy of his age, intelligence, and experience would have been able to avoid the collision.
B. Yes, because the boy intended to drive the boat, which caused her harm.
C. No, because the boy did not intend to strike the woman.
D. No, because the boy did not make direct physical contact with the woman.
