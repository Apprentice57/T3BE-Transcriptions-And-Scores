OA544: Debunking the Left's Rittenhouse Trial Myths

One winter, a man purchases swimming goggles from a nearby dive shop. The man does not use the swimming goggles until a couple months later when the weather gets warmer. Upon using the swimming goggles, he discovers that there is a defect in the lens which causes water to flood the goggles, rendering them effectively useless. The next day, the man brings the goggles back to the dive shop and demands his money back.

What is the manâ€™s best argument to receive his money back?

A. The swimming goggles are defective so he is rejecting them.
B. The swimming goggles are defective so he is revoking his acceptance of them.
C. The dive shop breached the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.
D. The harm suffered by the man was a foreseeable result of the dive shop's negligence.
