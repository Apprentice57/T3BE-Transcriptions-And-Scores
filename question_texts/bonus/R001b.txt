Thomas Takes the Bar Exam Returns! T3BE Week 1

A woman drove her car through the drive-through lane of a fast-food restaurant one afternoon. When she reached the microphone used to place orders, she said, "Thereâ€™s a man across the street with a rifle. He can see everything you do. If you do not do exactly what I tell you, he will shoot you. Put all the money from the register into a sack and give it to me when I drive up." The clerk did not see anyone across the street and was unsure whether anyone was there. However, unwilling to risk harm to himself, he put $500 in a paper bag and handed it to the woman when she drove up to the delivery window. The woman drove off with the money but was arrested a short time later. She had lied about there having been a man with a rifle and had acted alone.

Of what crime or crimes can the woman be convicted?

A. Embezzlement.
B. Obtaining property by false pretenses.
C. Robbery and larceny.
D. Robbery or larceny.
