Trump's Intelligence Picks - Doozies and Russian Assets

After the recent rainstorms, Thomas watched unhappily as the gutters on his house broke loose and toppled to the ground. As Thomas moved the broken pieces to the curb, his neighbor Matthew saw what happened and offered to put them back together and reinstall them for $1,500. Thomas said he wanted to consult with his wife, Lydia, first. After talking with Lydia, he waited until Matthew walked by again a month later and said, "I would gladly accept your kind offer to put my gutters back together and reinstall them. When can you begin?" Matthew replied, "I'm busy! You should call a professional."

Has a contract been formed between Thomas and Matthew?

A. No, because the offer had lapsed.
B. No, because Matthew is not a merchant.
C. Yes, because Matthew did not state a time period for accepting the offer.
D. Yes, because consulting with Lydia was not a rejection.
