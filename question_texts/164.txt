OA355: Honest Answers to Impeachment Questions

A college student was asleep in his bed in a college dormitory when his roommate, in a drunken fury, entered their room intending to attack the student with an ice pick while he slept. Fortunately, the phone rang and awakened the student. The roommate retreated quickly and threw the ice pick under his own bed in the same room. The next day, the student heard from friends about the roommate's murderous plans and later found the ice pick under the roommate's bed. Even though the college expelled his roommate, the student remained extremely upset and afraid to sleep.

In a suit against the roommate for assault, will the student prevail?

A. No, because the roommate did not touch the student.
B. No, because the student was not awake when the roommate entered the room and was unaware until later that the roommate was intending to attack him.
C. Yes, because it was reasonable for the student to feel afraid of sleeping in his room afterward.
D. Yes, because the roommate intended to inflict serious harm.
