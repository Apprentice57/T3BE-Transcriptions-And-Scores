OA48: Three Cases You Care About - Planned Parenthood, Gay Florists, and Litigious Quacks

A man is sitting on a beach chair peacefully and in a relaxed meditative state when a truck racing on the sand ran down a sunbathing elderly person. The man said out loud "Oh god, look what that truck driver did". The man driving that truck was racing and going about 100 miles an hour. Someone called 911. A woman who was sitting on the beach nearby but facing the other way heard the man's outcry.

When the case comes to trial, will the court allow both the man and the woman to testify about the man's utterances?

A. Yes, because both the woman and the man can testify because it is an excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule that goes to the material issue of the case.
B. Yes, because this is not hearsay and it is not being entered for the truth of the statement by either witness so that they can both testify.
C. No, neither of them can testify because the man was impaired due to being too relaxed from his meditation. My laughing is not an indication that this is an incorrect answer, but that is funny. And the woman cannot repeat the utterances of an impaired witness. Pretty clever.
D. No, neither can testify because the utterances do not fit any of the exceptions to the hearsay rule.
