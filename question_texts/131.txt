OA289: #OpposeJustinWalker

The defendant, a young doctor, was charged with falsely claiming deductions on her federal income tax return. At trial, a witness testified for the defendant that she has a reputation in the community for complete honesty. After a sidebar conference at which the prosecutor gave the judge a record showing that the defendant's medical school had disciplined her for altering her transcript, the prosecutor proposed to ask the witness on cross-examination: "Have you ever heard that the defendant falsified her medical school transcript?"

Is the prosecutor's question proper?

A. No, because it calls for hearsay not within any exception.
B. No, because its minimal relevance on the issue of income tax fraud is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.
C. Yes, because an affirmative answer will be probative of the defendant's character trait for dishonesty and, therefore, her guilt.
D. Yes, because an affirmative answer will impeach the witness's credibility.
