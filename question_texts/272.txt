OA586: CA Uses TX Abortion Ban Trick but for Gun Control

A city allows concerts to be held in its city park stadium. However, after hearing complaints about the noise level, the city passes an ordinance that requires groups that rent out the city park stadium to use the city's audio equipment found in the city park stadium. A particular band of a unique genre states that the cityâ€™s audio equipment found in the city park stadium is insufficient for the various songs it plans on performing. The city nonetheless insists that the band use the city's equipment. The band sues for a violation of its First Amendment rights.

Will the band be successful?

A. Yes, because the ordinance is not narrowly tailored to serve an important government interest.
B. Yes, because although the ordinance is constitutional on its face, it is unconstitutional as applied to the band.
C. No, because the ordinance serves an important government interest and there are no less restrictive means by which it can satisfy that interest.
D. No, because the ordinance is rationally related to a legitimate government interest.
