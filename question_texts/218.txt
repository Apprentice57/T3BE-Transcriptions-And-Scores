OA472: The American Rescue Plan - You Made This Happen!

A woman from State A filed an action against a retailer in a state court in State B. The complaint alleged that the retailer had not delivered $100,000 worth of goods for which the woman had paid.

Twenty days after being served, the retailer, which is incorporated in State C and has its principal place of business in State B, filed a notice of removal in a federal district court in State B.

Was the action properly removed?

A. No, because the notice of removal was not timely filed.
B. No, because the retailer is a citizen of State B.
C. Yes, because the parties are citizens of different states and more than $75,000 is in controversy.
D. Yes, because the retailer is a citizen of both State B and State C.
