OA239: The Fourth Circuit's Puzzling Emoluments Ruling

An associate professor in the pediatrics department of a local medical school was denied tenure. He asked a national education lobbying organization to represent him in his efforts to have the tenure decision reversed. In response to a letter from the organization on the professor's behalf, the dean of the medical school wrote to the organization explaining truthfully that the professor had been denied tenure because of reports that he had abused two of his former patients. Several months later, after a thorough investigation, the allegations were proven false, and the professor was granted tenure. He had remained working at the medical school at full pay during the tenure decision review process and thus suffered no pecuniary harm.

In a suit for libel by the professor against the dean of the medical school, will the professor be likely to prevail?

A. No, because the professor invited the libel.
B. No, because the professor suffered no pecuniary loss.
C. Yes, because the dean had a duty to investigate the rumor before repeating it.
D. Yes, because the deanâ€™s defamatory statement was in the form of a writing.
