OA542: Oklahoma Supreme Court Overturns Verdict Against Opioid Companies

On January 1, a man offered to sell his neighbor his lawn mower for $400. The neighbor was considering whether to purchase the lawn mower. The neighbor said to the man, "I cannot decide whether I want to buy your lawn mower. If I pay you $10.00 will you leave the offer open until January 5?" The man agreed to leave the offer open until January 5, and the neighbor paid the man $10.00.

On January 2, the neighbor told the man, "I reject your offer." The man did not take any steps in reliance on the neighbor's rejection. On January 3, the neighbor told the man, "I accept your offer."

Is there a contract between the neighbor and the man?

A. No, because the January 3 statement constituted a counteroffer.
B. No, because $10.00 is not considered to be adequate consideration to hold open an offer.
C. Yes, because the man did not take any steps in reliance on the neighbor's January 2 rejection and the neighbor accepted the offer prior to the January 5 deadline.
D. Yes, because an option contract can always be accepted during the time period that the offer is held open.
