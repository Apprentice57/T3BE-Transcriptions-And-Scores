OA217: Can Ethics Complaints Take Down Kavanaugh?

The personnel director of an investment company told a job applicant during his interview that the company was worth millions of dollars and that the company's portfolio would triple in the next several months. The applicant was very excited about the company's prospects and accepted an offer to work for the company. Two days later, the applicant read in the newspaper that the investment company had filed for bankruptcy reorganization. As a result of reading the news, the applicant suffered severe emotional distress but immediately found another comparable position.

Is the applicant likely to prevail in an action for negligent misrepresentation?

A. No, because the applicant did not suffer any physical injury or pecuniary loss.
B. No, because the personnel director's statement was purely speculative.
C. Yes, because the applicant relied on the personnel director's misrepresentations about the investment company.
D. Yes, because the personnel director should have foreseen that his misrepresentations would cause the applicant to be distressed.
