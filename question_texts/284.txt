OA611: Cipollone to Testify! Andrew Called It! Here's What To Expect.

A seller entered into a contract to convey Blackacre to a buyer. The contract stated that the closing was to occur "on May 1." The buyer was prepared to perform on May 1, but the seller was not. On June 1, the seller was ready to close on Blackacre. The buyer does not want to follow through with the closing and claims the seller has breached the contract.

Must the buyer follow through with the closing?

A. Yes, unless the buyer can show the delay of closing caused the buyer to suffer undue harm
B. Yes, unless the contract or the circumstances indicate that time is of the essence
C. No, because the closing date is an express term of the contract that must be complied with exactly.
D. No, because one month is not a reasonable time after the initial closing date.
