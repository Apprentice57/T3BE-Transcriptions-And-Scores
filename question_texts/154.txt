OA335: This Week in Impeachment

A homeowner was using a six-foot stepladder to clean the furnace in his home. The homeowner broke his arm when he slipped and fell from the ladder. The furnace had no warnings or instructions on how it was to be cleaned.

In a suit by the homeowner against the manufacturer of the furnace to recover for his injury, is the homeowner likely to prevail?

A. No, because the danger of falling from a ladder is obvious.
B. No, because the homeowner should have hired a professional to clean the furnace.
C. Yes, because the furnace did not have a ladder attached to it for cleaning purposes.
D. Yes, because the lack of warnings or instructions for how to clean the furnace made the furnace defective.
