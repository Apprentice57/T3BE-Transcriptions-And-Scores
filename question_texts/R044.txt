T3BE44: Parental Promised Pizza Payment Predicament

Scotty, Donald's adult son, called Benzino's Pizza to place an order for delivery that evening because Scotty was craving pizza. Typically, the restaurant requires customers to pay using a credit card when they place orders over the phone. However, Donald was a regular at the restaurant and yelled from the couch when Scotty placed the order: "If Scotty doesn't pay, don't worry-I have got it covered!" About 30 minutes later, a delivery driver arrived at Donald's house and delivered the order of delicious, hot, anchovy pizza. Scotty answered the door and refused to accept the food or pay for it as he changed his mind and decided to order Chinese food instead.

Can Benzino's Pizza collect what they are owed from Donald?

A. No, because a third party will not be held liable for the contract obligations of another.
B. No, because Donald's promise was made orally.
C. Yes, because a parent is liable to pay for necessities provided to their child.
D. Yes, because Donald promised to pay.
