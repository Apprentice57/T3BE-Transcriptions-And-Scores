OA251: Gerrymandering in Maryland Heads Back to SCOTUS

A state statute requires, without exception, that a woman under the age of 18 notify one of her parents at least 48 hours before having an abortion. A proper lawsuit has challenged the constitutionality of this state statute.

In that suit, should the court uphold the constitutionality of the statute?

A. No, because a 48-hour waiting period is excessively long, and therefore the statute imposes an undue burden on a womanâ€™s right to procure an abortion.
B. No, because the state law does not provide a bypass procedure that would allow a court to authorize a minor to obtain an abortion without prior parental notification under appropriate circumstances.
C. Yes, because parents' rights to supervise their minor daughter's health care outweigh any individual right the daughter may have.
D. Yes, because such parental notification and waiting-period requirements do not impose an undue burden on a minor's right to procure an abortion.
