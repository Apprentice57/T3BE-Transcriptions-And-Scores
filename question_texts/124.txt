OA275: Yes, Bill Barr Perjured Himself

A consumer became physically ill after drinking part of a bottle of soda that contained a large decomposed snail. The consumer sued the store from which she had bought the soda to recover damages for her injuries. The parties agreed that the snail had been put into the bottle during the bottling process, over which the store had no control. The parties also agreed that the snail would have been visible in the bottle before the consumer opened it.

Will the consumer be likely to prevail in an action against the store?

A. No, because the consumer could have seen the snail in the bottle before she drank out of it.
B. No, because the store was not responsible for the bottling process.
C. Yes, because the consumer was injured by a defective product sold to her by the store.
D. Yes, because the store had exclusive control over the bottle before selling it to the consumer.
