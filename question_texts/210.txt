OA456: Insurrections Have Consequences

A state law provides funding for public students using a complex formula. One of the major components of the formula takes into account property values surrounding the schools. This leads to a disparity in student funding as schools located in areas where property values are high have substantially more funding than schools located in areas where property values are not high. A group of students from a school located in an area with low property values challenges this law on the basis that it violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Who will prevail?

A. The state, because the state can show that the law is necessary to achieve a compelling government interest.
B. The state, because the students will not be able to show that the law is not rationally related to any legitimate government interest.
C. The students, because the students will be able to show that the law is not substantially related to an important government interest.
D. The students, because the state will not be able to show that the law is rationally related to a legitimate government interest.
