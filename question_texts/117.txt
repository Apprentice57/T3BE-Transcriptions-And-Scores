OA259: Your Guide to the Congressional Investigations

A group of students at a state university's law school wished to debate the future of affirmative action in that state and at that law school. For this debate, they requested the use of a meeting room in the law school that is available on a first-come, first-served basis for extracurricular student use. Speakers presenting all sides of the issue were scheduled to participate. The law school administration denied the use of its meeting room for this purpose solely because it believed that "such debate, even if balanced, would have a negative effect on the morale of the law school community and might cause friction among the students that would disrupt the institution's educational mission."

Is the law school’s denial of the use of its meeting room for this purpose constitutional?

A. No, because the law school cannot demonstrate that is action was necessary to serve a compelling state interest.
B. No, because the law school cannot demonstrate that its action was rationally related to a legitimate state interest.
C. Yes, because the law school’s only concern was the adverse effect of such a discussion of affirmative action on the immediate audience and the mission of the institution.
D. Yes, because the law students do not have a right to use a state-owned law school facility for a meeting that is not organized and sponsored by the law school itself.
