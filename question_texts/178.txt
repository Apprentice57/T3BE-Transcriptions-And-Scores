OA386: The Opening Arguments Amicus Brief!

A defendant was charged with attempted murder. At the preliminary hearing, the presiding judge heard the testimony of four
prosecution witnesses and found that the prosecution had failed to establish probable cause that the defendant had committed any offense. Accordingly, he dismissed the charge.

The prosecutor then called the same four witnesses before a grand jury. The grand jury indicted the same defendant for attempted murder.

The defendant has moved to quash the indictment on the ground of double jeopardy.

How should the court proceed?

A. Grant the motion, because the dismissal of the first charge on the merits, whether corrector incorrect, bars any further prosecution.
B. Grant the motion, unless the prosecution has evidence that was not presented in the first case.
C. Deny the motion, because the defendant has not yet been in jeopardy of conviction on the attempted murder charge.
D. Deny the motion, because the protection of the double jeopardy clause does not come into play until there has been a conviction or an acquittal further prosecution.
