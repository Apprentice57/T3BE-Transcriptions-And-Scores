OA180: Masterpiece Cakeshop

A grantor executed an instrument in the proper form of a warranty deed purporting to convey attractive land to his church. The granting clause of the instrument ran to the church, "and its successors forever, so long as the premises are used for church purposes". The church took possession of the land and used it as a site of worship for many years. Subsequently, the church decided to relocate and entered into a valid written contract to sell the land to a buyer for a substantial price. The buyer wanted to use the land as a site for business activities and objected to the church's title.

The contract contained no provision relating to the quality of the title the church was bound to convey. There is no applicable statute. When the buyer refused to close, the church sued the buyer for specific performance and properly joined the grand tour as a party. Is the church likely to prevail?

A. No, because the grantor's interest prevents the church's title from being marketable.
B. No, because the quoted provision is a valid restrictive covenant.
C. Yes, because a charitable trust to support religion will attach to the proceeds of the sale.
D. Yes, because the grantor cannot derogate from his warranty.
