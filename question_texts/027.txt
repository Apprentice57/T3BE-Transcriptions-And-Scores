OA76: "I Hope" James Comeyâ€™s Senate Testimony Shows Obstruction of Justice

A man was a passenger in a vehicle stopped at a red light. A drunk driver with a blood alcohol reading four times the legal limit rammed into the rear of the stopped vehicle without breaking and at a high speed. The passenger was severely and permanently injured. At trial, the drunk driver admitted liability so that the trial dealt with damages only. The drunk driver testified that he had no assets to pay a punitive damages award. He said that all he had was $100,000 in liability coverage. The court allowed the injured man's attorney to cross-examine the driver about his insurance coverage, and he elicited an admission that the driver knew that his company might have to pay the full award of the jury. The jury entered a verdict for $200,000 in compensatory damages and $500,000 in punitive damages.

Defendant appeals, claiming that it was improper to question on the amount of insurance coverage or to speculate on whether the full amount may have to be paid.

Will the appellate court likely affirm the award of punitive damages?

A. No. The punitive damages award cannot be excessively high and cannot exceed three times the compensatory damages amount.
B. No, because it is never proper to bring insurance information into the case against the defendant.
C. Yes, because defendant opened the door to that kind of cross-examination by testifying that he had no assets to pay a punitive damage award.
D. Yes, because the jury always has a right to be informed of the insurance coverage pertaining to each party in a tort case for personal injury damages.
