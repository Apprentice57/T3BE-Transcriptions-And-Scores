OA578: 1/6 Prosecutors Admit Violating Suspects Rights. What Happened?

A man asked an attorney to represent him pro bono in an appeal from the denial of his unemployment benefits. The attorney agreed, but missed the deadline to file the appeal. When the attorney discovered this error, he met with the man and presented a proposed settlement of the man's potential malpractice claim against himself, against the attorney. The attorney proposed to pay the man an amount equal to the unemployment benefits he would have received had his appeal been successful. In exchange, the man would agree to waive any malpractice claim. The attorney memorialized this proposed settlement in a written document that included a statement advising the man to seek independent legal counsel before accepting the settlement and stating that the man could take as long as he needed to do this.

However, without consulting independent legal counsel, the man agreed to and signed the proposed settlement the next week. The attorney subsequently paid the man the money he would have received from a successful appeal.

Is the attorney subject to discipline?

A. Yes, because the attorney made an agreement with the man to waive a potential claim for malpractice.
B. Yes, because the man did not consult independent counsel before he agreed to the proposed settlement.
C. No, because the attorney advised the man in writing to seek independent legal counsel before agreeing to the proposed settlement.
D. No, because the attorney agreed to fully compensate the man for his losses.
