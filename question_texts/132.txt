OA292: The End of Democracy

A homeowner owned a large poisonous snake which had been defanged and was kept in a cage. A storm damaged the homeowner's house and the snake's cage, allowing the snake to escape. During the cleanup after the storm, a volunteer worker came across the snake. The worker tried to run away from the snake and fell, breaking his arm.

In a suit by the worker against the homeowner based on strict liability in tort to recover for his injury, will the worker prevail?

A. No, because the snake's escape was caused by a force of nature.
B. No, because the worker should have anticipated an injury during his volunteer work.
C. Yes, because the homeowner did not take adequate precautions to secure the snake.
D. Yes, because the worker's injury was the result of his fear of the escaped snake.
