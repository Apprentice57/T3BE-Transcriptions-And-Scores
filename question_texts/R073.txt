The Part of Collections Collector

A retro video game collector, Peach, wrote a letter to her stepsister Daisy, offering to sell her collection of sports games for $5,000 because she knew Daisy had admired it for quite some time as Daisy loved professional wrestling and football games from popular franchises. The day after Daisy received the letter, she mailed a letter back to Peach agreeing to buy part of Peach's collection for $5,000. The next day, after describing the collection to a friend who was very knowledgeable about retro games and collection, Daisy learned that the collection was not worth more than $600 because it was comprised of all the games Peach was trying to offload from her extensive collection. Daisy immediately called Peach and told her she was no longer interested in buying the game collection. Peach received Daisy's letter agreeing to purchase the collection a day after receiving the phone call.

If Peach brings an action against Daisy for breach of contract, and Daisy defends on the grounds that no contract was formed, how should the court rule?

A. For Peach, because the contract is for the sale of goods valued over $500 and Daisy's rejection of the offer was oral.
B. For Peach, because Daisy's letter accepting the offer was effective when mailed.
C. For Daisy, because Peach received the phone call before she received the letter.
D. For Daisy, because the description of the subject matter of the contract was too indefinite to be enforced.
