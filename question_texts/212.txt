OA460: Did the Courts Really "Refuse to Hear Trump's Evidence" of Voter Fraud? (No.)

A landlord commercially leased his building to a woman who intended to open an ice cream shop. The woman installed an extensive amount of equipment in the building, which was permitted by the lease agreement, and she began making ice cream. She stored her ice cream in a freezer. However, the building's cooling system broke and her ice cream all melted. She asked the landlord to fix the cooling system, but he refused. She had to temporarily close her store while searching for a mechanic to fix the cooling system.

While the building was unusable for the purpose of storing ice cream, the woman remained on the premises to work on new marketing projects. Angry at the landlord for not fixing the cooling system, which has still not been fixed, the woman refused to make the next rent payment. The landlord began eviction proceedings, and in response, the woman sued the landlord for breach.

Assuming the lease agreement is silent on this matter, who will prevail?

A. The landlord, because the woman had no legal reason for withholding rent payments.
B. The landlord, because the woman surrendered the property when she did not pay rent.
C. The woman, because the landlord breached the implied warranty of habitability.
D. The woman, because the landlord breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment by constructively evicting her prior to the withholding of rent.
