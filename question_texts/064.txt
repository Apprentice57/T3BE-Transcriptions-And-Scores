OA150: Janus, The Angry Roman God Of Doorways (And Labor Law?)

Dubba's old Basenji Reb didn't like the new puppy and would hide from him during the day so as not to have his (Reb's) naps interrupted by an impromptu game of chew Reb's ear.

One warm evening, the dog Reb hid in the tool shed and was so deeply asleep that he didn't awaken when Dubba, the owner, shut and locked the shed for the night. When he, again  woke about midnight and discovered that he was locked in, Reb began jumping against the shed door. The loud banging of the tool shed door aroused Dubba from sleep. Thinking that his house was being burglarized, Dubba grabbed his loaded shotgun and tiptoed onto the back patio from where he heard the loud banging. In the dark of the patio, Dubba did not notice that his young daughter had left her jacks scattered about on the floor. When his bare feet encountered the jacks, Dubba was soon hopping in pain and fell over a patio table, crashing heavily to the floor.

Upon impact, the shotgun went off, both barrels blasting a hole in the patio screen. The pellet struck Dubba's neighbor Jimmy, who had also heard the thumping in the tool shed, and climbed over the fence which separated his yard from Dubba's, and Jimmy was killed instantly.

Which of the following is Dubba's strongest defense to a charge of involuntary manslaughter as a result of Jimmy's death?

A. Jimmy assumed the risk by trespassing on Dubba's property at night.
B. Dubba's actions that night did not constitute criminal negligence.
C. Jimmy's death did not result from a volitional act by Dubba.
D. Dubba was privileged to kill in defense of his home.
