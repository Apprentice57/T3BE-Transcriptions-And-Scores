OA54: Gerrymandering

A business person sent his employee and administrative assistant to represent him at a conference where business deals are often negotiated. The principal gave the assistant all of the materials to set up a table with the principal's cards, brochures, promotional materials, price lists, and even some order forms with his logo on them. In addition, the assistant represented the third parties that she was there officially representing the principal and that she was authorized to execute contracts on his behalf. The assistant negotiated a deal for the business person with a third party which the business person refused to honor because he did not like the terms that were negotiated

Will the third party likely prevail in enforcing the contract against the principal?

A, Yes, because the furnishing of the indication of authority to act To the employee was sufficient proof to bind the principal.
B. Yes, because the principal is bound to the employee's actions whenever he sends an employee to attend a convention on his behalf.
C. No, because people dealing with an assistant at a convention have a duty to determine whether that person is in fact an authorized agent.
D, No, because the technological revolution makes it easy these days for a potential customer to first confirm the existence of actual authority.
