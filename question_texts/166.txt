OA360: The Tuesday Afternoon Massacre

A plaintiff sued a defendant, alleging that she was seriously injured when the defendant ran a red light and struck her while she was
walking in a crosswalk. During the defendant's case, a witness testified that the plaintiff had told him that she was "barely touched" by the defendant's car.

On cross-examination, should the court allow the plaintiff to elicit from the witness the fact that he is an adjuster for the defendant's insurance company?

A. No, because testimony about liability insurance is barred by the rules of evidence.
B. No, because the reference to insurance raises a collateral issue.
C. Yes, for both substantive and impeachment purposes.
D. Yes, for impeachment purposes only.
