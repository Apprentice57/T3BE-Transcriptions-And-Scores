OA46: What Could Donald Trumpâ€™s Tax Returns Tell Us? (With Guest Tony Di Fatta) - Part 2

A witness sees a murder in the park and is called to testify in the criminal case. The defense counsel knows that she was cited several times for illegally feeding the pigeons. Defense counsel tried to ask "You have a long time habit of feeding the pigeons, don't you? You have, in fact, been ticketed several times for feeding pigeons, haven't you? And yet you persisted in doing it."

Will the trial court likely allow the witness to be questioned on these matters?

A. No, because the question has no probative value regarding the credibility of the witness or the guilt of the defendant.
B. No, because a witness can never be asked about personal prior bad acts.
C. Yes, because the statement indicates that the witness's attention was always focused on feeding the pigeons.
D. Yes, because feeding pigeons in the park and persisting in it after being ticketed may show an antisocial trait of the witness.
