OA343: The End of the ACA? (Also: Some Stuff About Impeachment)

A defendant is being tried for the murder of a woman who disappeared 10 years ago and has not been heard from since. Her body has never been found. The prosecutor has presented strong circumstantial evidence that she was murdered by the defendant. To help establish the fact of her death, the prosecutor has requested that the judge give the following instruction, based on a recognized presumption in the jurisdiction: "A person missing and not heard from in the last seven years shall be presumed to be deceased."

Is the instruction proper?

A. No, because the fact that someone has not been heard from in seven years does not necessarily lead to a conclusion that the person is dead.
B. No, because mandatory presumptions are not allowed against a criminal defendant on an element of the charged crime.
C. Yes, because it expresses a rational conclusion that the jury should be required to accept.
D. Yes, because the defendant has a chance to rebut the presumption by offering evidence that the woman is alive or has been heard from in the last seven years.
