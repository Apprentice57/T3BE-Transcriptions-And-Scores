OA623: This Week in High Treason

A man was taken to a police station for questioning after his girlfriend disappeared. The man was not given Miranda warnings. After a few minutes of questioning by a police officer, the man confessed to murdering his girlfriend and told the police officer that he threw the gun that he used to shoot his girlfriend in a swamp, which was located several miles from the city. After an intensive search of the swamp over a period of several weeks, the police found the gun. The man is charged with first-degree murder. The prosecutor plans to use the gun as evidence against the man at trial.

The man argues that the gun should be suppressed at trial. Will he prevail?

A. Yes, because the man was not given Miranda warnings.
B. Yes, because the interrogation violated the man's due process rights.
C. No, because the exclusionary rule will not serve to exclude the gun from evidence.
D. No, pursuant to the "inevitable discovery" exception to the exclusionary rule.
