OA398: The SCOTUS Asylum Ruling, Explained

Seven years ago, a man, his sister, and his cousin became equal owners, as tenants in common, of a house. Until a year ago, the man lived in the house alone. The sister and the cousin are longtime residents of another state.

One year ago, the man moved to an apartment and rented the house to a tenant for three years under a lease that the man and the tenant both signed. The tenant has since paid the rent each month to the man.

Recently, the sister and the cousin learned about the rental. They brought an appropriate action against the tenant to have the lease declared void and to have the tenant evicted, The tenant raised all available defenses.

What will the court likely decide?

A. The lease is void, and the tenant is evicted.
B. The lease is valid, and the tenant retains exclusive occupancy rights for the balance of the term.
C. The lease is valid, but the tenant is evicted because one-third of the lease term has expired and the man had only a one-third interest to transfer.
D. The lease is valid, and the tenant is not evicted but must share possession with the sister and the cousin.
