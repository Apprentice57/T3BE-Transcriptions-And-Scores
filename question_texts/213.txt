OA462: Rittenhouse Team Commits Perjury; DC Statehood and Impeachment!

A woman was walking across the street when she was struck by a vehicle traveling at a high rate of speed. As she was laying on the pavement dying, she told a bystander who was at her side, "I know I am dying. I want to tell you before I die that I saw my neighbor steal the Madonna painting from the museum." The woman then died.

In a civil suit by the museum against the neighbor for conversion, is the woman's statement to the bystander admissible?

A. Yes, as an excited utterance.
B. Yes, as a dying declaration.
C. No, because it would violate the neighbor's Sixth Amendment right of confrontation.
D. No, it is inadmissible hearsay.
