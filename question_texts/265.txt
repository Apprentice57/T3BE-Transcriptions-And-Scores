OA568: How Christian Nationalism Fueled the Insurrection

An attorney represented a mother in a child custody dispute. The father of the child was not represented by a lawyer. The mother told the attorney that she wanted to resolve the custody dispute amicably and asked the attorney to meet with the father to see if an agreement could be reached before the upcoming court date.

The attorney met with the father, presented the mother's proposed custody arrangement, and asked the father to agree to it. The father asked the attorney whether the custody arrangement was fair. The attorney advised the father to hire his own lawyer if he wanted advice regarding the fairness of the arrangement. The attorney did not offer any other advice. The father hired a lawyer, and the matter turned into an antagonistic negotiation that had to be resolved in court.

Is the attorney subject to discipline?

A. Yes, because the attorney asked the father to agree to the proposed custody arrangement.
B. Yes, because the attorney advised the father to hire his own lawyer.
C. No, because the attorney offered the father no advice other than to hire his own lawyer.
D. No, because a lawyer may give legal advice to an unrepresented opposing party.
