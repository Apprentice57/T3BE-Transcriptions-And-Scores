OA609: Surprise Jan 6 Hearing Bombshells Within Smocking Guns Within More Bombshells

A city enacted an ordinance banning all flyers consisting of wholly commercial advertisements on utility poles on public sidewalks. The reason for the ordinance was to prevent litter on the public streets and sidewalks. However, the city continued to allow other kinds of flyers to be displayed on utility poles on public sidewalks. As a result of the ordinance, approximately 50 of the 500 flyers were removed from the utility poles since they consisted of wholly commercial advertisements.

Is the ordinance constitutional?

A. Yes, because it is commercial speech and subject to a lesser scrutiny than other kinds of speech.
B. Yes, because prohibiting litter is a substantial government interest and the ordinance is necessary to effectuate this interest.
C. No, because prohibiting litter is not a compelling government interest.
D. No, because there is not a reasonable fit between the law and the outcome desired by the city.
