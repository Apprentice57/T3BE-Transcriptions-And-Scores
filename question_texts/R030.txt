OA Bar Prep with Heather! T3BE30

A Quick Mart was robbed and the cashier was shot. The next day, the police arrested a suspect and brought him into the police station for questioning. An officer read the suspect his Miranda rights, which he stated he understood. For two hours, a police officer questioned the suspect about his involvement in the robbery. The suspect did not respond to the questions, remaining silent. After learning the cashier died, the officer informed the suspect of the cashier's death, and told him that he should start talking if he wanted to get the best plea deal. The suspect then confessed to both the robbery and shooting. At trial, the suspect sought to suppress his confession.

Is the confession likely to be suppressed for violation of Miranda rights?

A. No, because the suspect waived his Miranda rights by making the statement.
B. No, because the suspect's statement was not made in response to a question from police.
C. Yes, because the suspect did not receive fresh Miranda warnings before he was told of the cashier's death.
D. Yes, because the suspect invoked his Miranda rights by remaining silent in the face of police questioning for over an hour.
