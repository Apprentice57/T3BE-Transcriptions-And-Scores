OA534: State and Federal Agencies Now Fighting EACH OTHER in Blizzard Activision Case

A recent deluge of rain in state a left the ground very unstable. In an effort to protect against infrastructure problems. Congress passed a law imposing a strict maximum weight for all shipping trucks attempting to enter State A on its toll highway. The weight was lower than the weight limit of any of the surrounding states. Companies that operated solely in state A were unburdened as they did not need to pass through the laying checkpoints. However, companies that utilize shipping trucks that
drove through state A were forced to either drive around state A or lessen their loads in order to pass through the state.

A business in state B decided to challenge this law.

Which are the following arguments would be the businesses best argument that the law is unconstitutional?

A. the law imposes an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce.
B. The law discriminates against out-of-state citizens in violation of Article 4.
C. the law is not necessarily and narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest.
D. the law is not rationally related to a legitimate government interest.
