OA418: D.C. Circuit Panel's Multiple Bad Court Thingies

A businesswoman owned two adjoining tracts of land, one that was improved with a commercial rental building and another that was vacant and abutted a river.

Twenty years ago, the businesswoman conveyed the vacant tract to a grantee by a warranty deed that the businesswoman signed but the grantee did not. The deed contained a covenant by the grantee as owner of the vacant tract that neither he nor his heirs or assigns would "erect any building" on the vacant tract, in order to preserve the view of the river from the commercial building on the improved tract. The grantee intended to use the vacant tract as a nature preserve. The grantee promptly and property recorded the deed.

Last year, the businesswoman conveyed the improved tract to a businessman. A month later, the grantee died, devising all of his property including the vacant land, to his cousin.

Six weeks ago, the cousin began construction of a building on the vacant tract. The businessman objected and sued to enjoin construction of the building.

Who is likely to prevail?

A. The businessman, because the commercial building was constructed before the cousin began his construction project.
B. The businessman, because the cousin is bound by the covenant made by the grantee.
C. The cousin, because an equitable servitude does not survive the death of the promisor.
D. The cousin, because the grantee did not sign the deed.
