OA320: The (Idiotic) Hearsay Defense

A bright 12-year-old child attended a day-care center after school. The day-care center was located near a man-made duck pond on the property of a corporation. During the winter, the pond was used for ice-skating when conditions were suitable. At a time when the pond was obviously only partially frozen, the child sneaked away from the center's property and walked out onto the ice over the pond. The ice gave way, and the child fell into the cold water, He suffered shock and would have drowned had he not been rescued by a passerby. At the time of the incident, the pond was clearly marked with numerous signs that stated, "THIN ICE-KEEP OFF." When the child sneaked away from the day-care center, the center was staffed with a reasonable number of qualified employees, and the employees were exercising reasonable care to ensure that the children in their charge did not leave the premises. There had not been a previous instance of a child coming onto the corporation's property from the day-care center. The jurisdiction follows a rule of pure comparative negligence.

In a suit brought on the child's behalf against the corporation and based only on the facts above, who is likely to prevail?

A. The child, because the corporation owes a duty to keep its premises free of dangerous conditions.
B. The child, because the pond was an attractive nuisance.
C. The corporation, because the danger of thin ice may reasonably be expected to be understood by a 12-year-old child.
D. The corporation, because the day-care center had a duty to keep the child off the ice.
