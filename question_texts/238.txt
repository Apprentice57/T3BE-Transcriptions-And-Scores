OA512: Actions Continue to Have Consequences!

A consumer from State A filed a $100,000 products liability action in federal court against a manufacturer incorporated and with its principal place of business in State B. The consumer claimed that a flaw in the manufacturer's product had resulted in severe injuries to the consumer. In its answer, the manufacturer asserted a third-party complaint against the product designer, also incorporated and with its principal place of business in State B. Believing that the consumer had sued the wrong defendant, the manufacturer claimed both that the designer was solely responsible for the flaw that had led to the consumer's injuries and that the manufacturer was not at fault.

The designer is aware that the manufacturer did not follow all of the designer's specifications when making the product.

Which of the following arguments is most likely to achieve the designer's goal of dismissal of the third-party complaint?

A. The court does not have subject-matter jurisdiction over the third-party complaint, because both the manufacturer and the designer are citizens of State B.
B. The manufacturer failed to obtain the courtâ€™s leave to file the third-party complaint.
C. The manufacturer's failure to follow the designer's specifications caused the flaw that resulted in the consumer's injuries.
D. The manufacturer's third-party complaint failed to state a proper third-party claim.
