OA448: Secret Expert Witness "Spyder" is Dude Named Josh

A restaurant owner sued a city official who condemned her building, arguing that the official wanted the land for his own personal profit. The restaurant owner filed a request for a preliminary injunction to prevent the destruction of her building until the case could be resolved at trial. The court granted this request. The city official asserted a claim of immunity, arguing that he did not have to stand trial. He also filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The court denied both of the city official's requests. The official wanted to immediately appeal all three decisions before trial and sought the advice of his attorney.

Which of the following is the best and most accurate piece of advice the attorney could give?

A. None of these decisions are appealable until the case is completed to the end.
B. All three of these decisions are immediately appealable as they are all either of grave importance or could resolve the case then and there.
C. Only the granting of the preliminary injunction is immediately appealable as an interlocutory order.
D. Both the granting of the preliminary injunction and the denial of immunity are immediately appealable.
