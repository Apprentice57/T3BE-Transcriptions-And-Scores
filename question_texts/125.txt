OA277: The Republican Civil War

A defendant is on trial for attempted fraud. The state charges that the defendant switched a price tag from a cloth coat to a more expensive fur-trimmed coat and then presented the latter for purchase at the cash register. The defendant has testified in her own behalf that someone else must have switched the tag. On cross-examination, the prosecutor asks whether the defendant was convicted on two prior occasions of misdemeanor fraud of a retailer by the same means of switching the Price tag on a fur-trimmed coat.

Is the question about the prior convictions proper either to impeach the defendant or to prove that the defendant committed the crime?

A. It is not proper for either purpose.
B. It is proper for both purposes.
C. It is proper to impeach the defendant, but not to prove that the defendant committed the crime.
D. It is proper to prove that the defendant committed the crime, but not to impeach the defendant.
