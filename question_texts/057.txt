OA136: Chevron Deference Has Consequences - Particularly For Paul Manafort!

Guy was hiking in the High Sierra in April, when a severe late season blizzard set in. He became lost in the snow and wandered for several hours trying to follow whimpering creek downstream. Fortunately, he came across a small seemingly unoccupied cabin, which he entered for shelter by breaking the lock and then fell asleep.

Several hours later Basil, the owner of the cabin, roared up on his snowmobile and finding Guy in the Cabin demanded that Guy leave. When Guy refused, pointing out that the storm as at its peak, Basil dragged Guy out into the snow and then closed and locked the door.

Utterly by chance, Guy managed to find another cabin, but suffered severe frostbite leading to the loss of several toes.

If Guy sues Basil who will win?

A) Basil, because Guy refused to leave when asked.
B) Guy, because Basil did not behave as a reasonable person under the circumstances.
C) Guy, because the blizzard was a life threatening situation.
D) Basil, because Guy damaged his Cabin.
