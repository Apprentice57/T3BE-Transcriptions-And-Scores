OA52: Thomas Knows Words! Thomas Has The Best Words!

An elderly woman was mugged and robbed on a public street. At the time of the offense, the victim saw only her assailant's eyes. A hooded sweatshirt and bandanna concealed the rest of his face. A few days later, while the victim waited to be interviewed, she observed the defendant being escorted through the courthouse in jail clothing and restrained by handcuffs and leg irons. She identified him as the perpetrator shortly thereafter.

Will the court allow that identification into evidence?

A. No, because it is not reliable enough and there was too much suggestion to make a reasonably accurate identification.
B. No, because prior statements of identification are considered hearsay and never allowed it to evidence.
C. Yes, if the witness perceived the perpetrator by seeing his eyes and made the identification on that basis, it was reliable enough to be admitted.
D. Yes, because the witness's recognition of someone is all that is needed. The reliability or credibility of it is subject to cross-examination.
