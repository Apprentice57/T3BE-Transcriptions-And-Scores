OA351: Who's the Next Justin Amash? Your Guide to Impeachment, Part XVIII (Feat. Lev Parnas)

A woman and her sister took a trip to the Caribbean. When they passed through U.S. Customs inspection upon their return, the customs officials found packages of cocaine stitched inside separate carry-on bags belonging to each of them. They were arrested.

Upon separate questioning by customs officers, the woman broke down and cried, "I told my sister there were too many officers at this airport." The sister did not give a statement. The woman and her sister were indicted for conspiracy to import cocaine. They were tried separately. At the woman's trial, after the government introduced the above evidence and rested its case, her lawyer moved for a judgment of acquittal on grounds of insufficient evidence.

Should the court grant the motion?

A. No, because the evidence shows that both the woman and her sister agreed to import cocaine.
B. No, because the evidence shows that both the woman and her sister possessed cocaine.
C. Yes, because the evidence shows only that the woman and her sister committed separate crimes of cocaine possession.
D. Yes, because the evidence shows that the woman effectively withdrew from the conspiracy when she cooperated by giving a statement.
