OA227: Brian Frosh Takes On Matthew Whitaker & More!

A debtor owed a lender $1,500. The statute of limitations barred recovery on the claim. The debtor wrote to the lender, stating, "I promise to pay you $500 if you will extinguish the debt." The lender agreed.

Is the debtor's promise to pay the lender $500 enforceable?

A. No, because the debtor made no promise not to plead the statute of limitations as a defense.
B. No, because there was no consideration for the debtor's promise.
C. Yes, because the debtor's promise provided a benefit to the lender.
D. Yes, because the debtor's promise to pay part of the barred antecedent debt needs no consideration to be enforceable.
