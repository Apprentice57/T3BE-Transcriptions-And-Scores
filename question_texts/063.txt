OA148: The Parkland Massacre

Penny was riding an escalator in Dirk's department store when suddenly the escalator sped up and then came to a very quick stop, throwing people against each other and then down the escalator.

Penny tried to hold onto the railing but was unsuccessful. She was thrown violently to the left. Felt a horrible pain in her back and then tumbled down the escalator to the bottom. Officials of Dirk's department store promptly called their industrial health nurse who examined Penny and summoned an ambulance. When the ambulance arrived, paramedics placed Penny on the stretcher. And just as they picked up the stretcher to take her to the hospital, Penny heard Clara, a customer of the store, say "yesterday I heard Cora, another customer, tell Dirk that the escalator was acting funny, you know, speeding up and stopping".

Penny was treated at the hospital, must undergo rehabilitation treatment for her badly injured back. She now sues Dirk's department store for her injuries and at trial calls Clara, that's the customer she overheard, to testify as to Cora's remark. The lawyer for Dirks objects.

How should the court rule?

A. Admissible as a statement against interest.
B. Admissible as relevant evidence that Dirks was aware of the defect and did nothing to correct it.
C. Inadmissible unless Cora cannot be located as a witness.
D. Inadmissible as hearsay not within any exception.
