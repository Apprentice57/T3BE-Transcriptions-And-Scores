OA130: California on Fire

Pluto went to Amy, an attorney, who agreed to file suit on his behalf on a contingent fee basis. Very common practice. Amy sent Pluto to see Dr. Sawbones, a physician, for the purpose of examining Pluto prior to trial and assessing the extent of his injuries. During the course of the examination, Pluto made some statements to Sawbones indicating that he was not completely free from negligence when the accident occurred. Duck seeks to call Sawbones to testify to the statements Pluto made to Sawbones. Amy objects.

The objection by Amy should be:

A. Overruled because Pluto made an admission.
B. Overruled because a physician qualifies as an expert witness.
C. Sustained because the attorney-client privilege applies.
D. Sustained because the physician-patient privilege applies.
