The Pro-vaccine Republican Doctor Who Just Gave His Vote to RFK, Jr.

Sally was shopping at her local flea market on Sunday morning when she noticed a set of beautiful, hand-carved book ends. As an avid book collector, Sally was delighted to find such lovely and unique items to display in her home. She turned to the person next to her and asked how much the book ends cost. The person said, "$350." Sally paid the person the money, took the book ends, and happily displayed them in her home library. The person Sally spoke with was not the owner of the book ends but a bystander who left with the $350.

What crime at common law has the bystander committed regarding the $350?

A. No crime.
B. Robbery.
C. Extortion.
D. Obtaining property by false pretenses.
