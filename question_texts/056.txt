One night after Devereaux had been in California for about six months, he missed his girlfriend in Texas so badly that he wanted to leave California immediately. Lacking cash for the trip, Devereaux approached his friend Sam for a loan. Sam declined. Devereaux then went to his neighbor, Hugh, and offered to buy Hugh's used stove for $50. Devereaux wrote Hugh a check for $50 for the stove. Devereaux then sold the stove to Sam for $50 and left for Texas.
