OA436: It's A Runoff!

A rancher and his neighbor were involved in a boundary dispute. In order to resolve their differences, each drove his truck to an open
pasture area on his land where the two properties were separated by a fence. The rancher was accompanied by four friends, and the neighbor was alone.

The neighbor got out of his truck and walked toward the fence. The rancher got out but simply stood by his truck. When the neighbor came over the fence, the rancher shot him, inflicting serious injury.

In a battery action brought by the neighbor against the rancher, the rancher testified that he actually thought his neighbor was armed, although he could point to nothing that would have reasonably justified this belief.

Is the neighbor likely to prevail?

A. No, because the rancher was standing on his own property and had no obligation to retreat.
B. No, because the rancher suspected that the neighbor was armed.
C. Yes, because deadly force is never appropriate in a property dispute.
D. Yes, because it was unreasonable for the rancher to consider the use of a gun necessary for self-defense,
