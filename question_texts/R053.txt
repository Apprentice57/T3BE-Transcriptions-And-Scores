A Law for Christmas, and a Happy New Year

Jenny sued Dan for the broken leg she sustained when Dan's truck hit her while she was crossing the street. Jenny testified that she was walking across the street in the crosswalk with the green light when she was hit. Dan argues that Jenny was crossing against the red light and that he was unable to stop his truck in time to prevent the accident. To support her assertion, Jenny called the owner of a cafe on the corner where the accident occurred who testified that, "I saw Jenny cross the street for five years and she has never walked against the red light."

The cafe owner's testimony should be:

A. Excluded, unless the ownter actually saw Jenny crossing the street on the day of the accident.
B. Excluded, because evidence of specific instances of conduct is not admissible to prove conduct in conformity with character on a particular occasion.
C. Admitted, because it is relevant as to whether Jenny crossed against the red light on this occasion.
D. Admitted, to show that Jenny had a reputation for acting safely.
