OA56: Jury Secrecy and Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado

A man went shopping to buy a used car. He found one on a used car lot that was offered, quote, as is. He looked at it thoroughly. The tag on the window indicated a special 30-point inspection was done on the car. The man put a $1,000 down payment down on the car. He took the car to an independent mechanic who told him that the car had been in an accident, sustained severe damage, including a cracked engine block. The mechanic believed that the dealer had to know about such extensive damage. The man tried to return the car and get his down payment back, but the dealer refused. Stuck with a lemon, the man sued the company under a common law fraud theory. The company counterclaimed for the balance of the purchase price.

Will the man likely prevail in the litigation?

A. Yes, the man will likely prevail in the litigation because the dealer withheld material information intentionally and knowingly misrepresenting the condition of the car.
B. Yes, because the dealer has a duty to give every reason why an as-is car may go bad and list those reasons on the window.
C. No, because the dealer cannot be held responsible for possible damage that the used car may have developed after years of use.
D. No, because the dealer is absolutely protected when he sells a used car in as-is condition.
