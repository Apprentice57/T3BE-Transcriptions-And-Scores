OA384: Bridgegate Apparently Was Fine

A gas company built a large refining facility that conformed to zoning requirements on land near a landowner’s property. The landowner had his own home and a mini-golf business on his property.

In a nuisance action against the gas company, the landowner established that the refinery emitted fumes that made many people feel quite sick when they were outside on his property for longer than a few minutes. The landowner’s mini-golf business had greatly declined as a consequence, and the value of his property had gone down markedly.

Is the landowner likely to prevail?

A. No, because the landowner has offered no evidence demonstrating that the gas company was negligent.
B. No, because the refinery conforms to the zoning requirements.
C. Yes, because the refinery has substantially and unreasonably interfered with the landowner’s use and enjoyment of his property.
D. Yes, because the value of the landowner’s property has declined.
