OA550: Oxford Shooter's Parents Charged

A man owned 3 houses in a suburban neighborhood. One day he discovered that the second step of his front porch was very wobbly. Without the time to fix the step this month, he created a sign to hang on the handrail that leads up to the stairs. The sign said, "USE CAUTION - WOBBLY STEP - COULD CAUSE INJURIES." The sign was properly placed and easily visible. A few days later, the man invited one of his new neighbors, an elderly woman, over for lunch. The neighbor approached the stairs, saw the sign, but decided to use the staircase regardless. When she stepped on the wobbly stair, it caused her to slip. The neighbor was still healing from a recently broken hip, and the resulting fall from this slip caused her hip to re-break.

If the neighbor were to sue the man for negligence, who Is most likely to win?

A. The neighbor, because the man breached his duty to the neighbor to make the step as safe as soon as he learned of the dangers.
B. The neighbor, because the step was the the actual and proximate cause of the injury.
C. The man, because he did not breach a duty that he owed to the neighbor.
D. The man, because the neighbor assumed the risk that she may fall.
