OA615: Rep. Jared Huffman on the Health Share Transparency Act

A man and a woman own neighboring pieces of land. The man wants to build an in-ground pool in his backyard. Fearing that if not properly maintained the pool could cause damage to her yard and attract unwanted plants and animals, the woman makes the man promise to have the pool cleaned and maintained by someone qualified once every two weeks while in use. This promise was reduced in writing and contained the following clause: "It is our intent that this agreement will bind our successors unless an agreement is reached between the owners at that time."

The man and the woman had this written agreement added into the deeds of both pieces of property

One year later, the man granted his land to his son, and the woman granted her land to her daughter. There were no discussions about the pool maintenance promise. Two months later, the daughter noticed that the pool was in disrepair as no one had cleaned it since the son moved in, although he had been using it. The daughter filed for an injunction demanding that the son resume cleaning his pool.

A. The son, because there was no horizontal privity between the man and the woman.
B. The son, because there was no horizontal privity between the son and the daughter.
C. The daughter, because she is an original party to the contract and can enforce it against the other original party or any party in privity.
D. The daughter, because she sought an injunction.
