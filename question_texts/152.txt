OA330: The Impeachment Inquiry Explainer (& Pre-Embryos in Connecticut)

A carpenter contracted with a homeowner to remodel the homeownerâ€™s home for $10,000, the contract price to be paid on completion of the work. On May 29, relying on the expectation that he would finish the work and have the homeowner's payment on June 1, the carpenter contracted to buy a car under the following terms: "$10,000 in cash, if payment is made on June 1; if payment is made thereafter, the price is $12,000." The carpenter completed the work according to specifications on June 1 and demanded payment from the homeowner on that date. The homeowner, without any excuse, refused to pay. As a result, the carpenter became very excited, suffered a minor heart attack, and incurred related medical expenses of $4,000. The reasonable value of the carpenter's services in remodeling the homeowner's home was $13,000.

In an action by the carpenter against the homeowner, which of the following should be the carpenter's measure of
recovery?

A. $10,000, the contract price.
B. $14,000, the contract price plus $4,000 for the medical expenses incurred because the homeowner refused to pay.
C. $12,000, the contract price plus $2,000, the bargain that was lost because the carpenter could not pay cash for the car on June 1.
D. $13,000, the amount the homeowner was enriched by the carpenter's services.
