a dance student worked very hard to strengthen her legs, including performing additional activities such as leaping and bounding up multiple flights of stairs in her apartment building. While she was performing her exercises, one of the janitors in the building warned her that "she was bound to get hurt if she keeps it up because there are problems with that floor." So janitor warns her you're bound to get hurt. After falling and breaking a leg due to the loose floorboard, she brought suit against the building owner. The building owner wants to testify that "The janitor told me I told her that running too fast is dangerous and she was bound to get hurt."

Is the building owner's statement likely to be held admissible?

A. Yes, because it is an exception to hearsay as a spontaneous declaration to an opponent party.
B. Yes, because the building owner can testify and be questioned about what the janitor told him.
C. No, because it is irrelevant and immaterial.
D. No, because it is hearsay within hearsay, and there are no hearsay exceptions that apply.
