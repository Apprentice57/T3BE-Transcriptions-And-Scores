The Thursday Night Massacre, Part 2

Ben and Sabrina were living in different states when they entered into a valid agreement stating that Ben would buy and Sabrina would sell a painting. The contract claimed that the painting was an original by Georgia O'Keefe reportedly worth $3 million, and Ben agreed to pay that amount. In a separate valid contract, Ben agreed to purchase a beachfront home in California from Sabrina worth $10 million. The purchase of the painting was completed on July 1.

Before Ben brought the home, he resold the painting but only received $500 because it turned out to be a forgery. Ben promptly told Sabrina of his intent to sue her for $3 million in damages. Sabrina then informed him that she would not move forward with the sale of the home.

Ben filed suit against Sabrina in federal court in California. Ben claimed fraud as to the painting and sought $3 million in damages. Ben also claimed breach of contract as to the home, and sought specific performance. He demanded a jury trial on all issues.

Is Ben entitled to a jury trial?

A. Yes, as to both the fraud claim and the breach of contract claim.
B. Yes as to the fraud claim, but no as to the breach of contract claim.
C. No as to the fraud claim, but yes as to the breach of contract claim.
D. No, as to both the fraud claim and the breach of contract claim.
