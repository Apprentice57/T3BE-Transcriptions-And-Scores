OA166: The Taint Team (& Also, Alex Jones)

A landowner executed an instrument in the proper form of a deed purporting to convey his land to a friend. The landowner handed the instrument to the friend saying "This is yours, but please do not record it until after I'm dead. Otherwise, it will cause me no end of trouble with my relatives". Two days later, the landowner asked the friend to return the deed to him because he had decided that he should devise the land to the friend by will rather than by deed. The friend said that he would destroy the deed and so a day or so later falsely told the landowner that the deed had been destroyed. Six months ago, the landowner, who had never executed a will, died intestine, survived by a daughter as his sole heir. The day after the landowner's death, the friend recorded the deed from him. As soon as the daughter discovered this recording and the friend's claim to the land, she brought an appropriate action against the friend to quiet title to the land.

For whom should the court hold?

A. The daughter, Because the death of the landowner deprived the subsequent recording of any effect.
B. The daughter because the friend was dishonest in reporting that he had destroyed the deed.
C. The friend because the deed was delivered to him.
D. The friend because the deed was recorded by him.
