OA332: Your Two New Best Friends, Bill Taylor and George Kent

A plaintiff sued her employer, alleging that poor working conditions had caused her to develop a stomach ulcer. At trial, the plaintiff's medical expert testified to the cause of the plaintiff's ulcer and stated that his opinion was based in part on information in a letter the plaintiffs personal doctor had written to the plaintiffs employer, explaining why the plaintiff had missed work.

When offered to prove the cause of the plaintiff's condition, is the letter from the plaintiff's doctor admissible?

A. No, because it is hearsay not within any exception.
B. No, because the plaintiff's doctor is not shown to be unavailable.
C. Yes, because it was relied upon by the plaintiff's medical expert.
D. Yes, under the business records exception to the hearsay rule.
