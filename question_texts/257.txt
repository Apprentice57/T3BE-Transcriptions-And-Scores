OA552: Will Joe Manchin Save Democracy? No, Really! ... Stop Laughing...

A man sued his boss in state court, alleging claims for nonpayment of wages under both state and federal law. The man’s friend, who was an attorney, advised the man to remove the case to federal court on the basis of federal question jurisdiction because he thought the federal court would be more sympathetic to the man’s claim. The man thereafter promptly removed the case to federal court. The man’s boss made a timely motion to remand the case to state court
