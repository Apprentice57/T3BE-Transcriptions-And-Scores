OA470: Can Harris Just Overrule the Parliamentarian?

A man has four German shepherd dogs that he has trained for guard duty and that he holds for breeding purposes. The man has "Beware of Dogs" signs clearly posted around a fenced-in yard where he keeps the dogs. The man's nextdoor neighbor frequently walks past the man’s house and knows about the dogs’ ferocity. One summer day, the neighbor entered the man’s fenced-in yard to retrieve a snow shovel that the man had borrowed during the past winter. The neighbor was attacked by one of the dogs and was severely injured.

In a suit against the man, is the neighbor likely to prevail?

A. No, because the neighbor knew that the man had dangerous dogs in the yard.
B. No, because the neighbor was trespassing when he entered the man’s property.
C. Yes, because the neighbor was an invitee for the purpose of retrieving the shovel.
D. Yes, because the man was engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity.
