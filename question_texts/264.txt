OA566: Explosive Lawsuit Against the NFL Details Racial Bias

A state trial court judge was assigned an action that sought to invalidate a testamentary trust as violating the rule against perpetuities. The judge had no experience in estate matters and did not find the briefs submitted by the parties to be helpful. Without prior notice to the parties, the judge consulted another trial judge with extensive experience in estate planning concerning the essential aspects of the rule. The judge was careful during the consultation to avoid identifying the parties or receiving any factual information that was not part of the record. The judge then personally decided the matter. She neither informed the parties about her consultation with the other judge nor gave them the opportunity to object or respond.
