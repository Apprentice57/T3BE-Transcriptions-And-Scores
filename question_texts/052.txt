OA126: Mick Mulvaney & The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau

Congress passed a law imposing a 50% excise tax on each pack of cigarettes manufactured for sale in the United States. An amendment was successfully added to the original bill requiring that all proceeds from the tax be used for anti-smoking educational programs in audio, video, and print media and elsewhere. The amendment also provided for the establishment of federal stop-smoking clinics funded through the excise tax. The various tobacco companies were required to pay the tax directly to the federal government. Puffham Tobacco Company filed suit in the appropriate federal court, praying that the tax be struck down as unconstitutional.

The court is likely to rule:

A. The tax is constitutional because the tax is severable from its purpose.
B. The tax is constitutional because the broad provisions of the general welfare clause would condone it.
C. The tax is unconstitutional because it does not provide equal time for the tobacco companies to present their side of the smoking controversy.
D. The tax is unconstitutional because it abridges the First Amendment rights of tobacco manufacturers by forcing them to pay for messages they may not agree with.
