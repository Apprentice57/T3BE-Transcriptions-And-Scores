OA627: How To Convict Donald Trump

A local resident arrived at his favorite fast-food restaurant intending to purchase lunch. When the resident entered the building he accidentally bumped into another patron, causing some of the patron's drink to spill on the floor. The collision was not observed by any restaurant employees. The resident proceeded to order his food. About one minute later, another customer entered, slipped on the wet floor, and sustained a broken wrist from the fall, which necessitated a surgical operation. Arguing that the restaurant was negligent in protecting patrons from dangers, the customer sued the restaurant in tort.

Will the customer succeed in his cause of action?

A. Yes, because the restaurant breached its duty to inspect the premises and warn of the dangerous condition or make it safe.
B. Yes, because the restaurant is vicariously liable for the torts of its patrons.
C. No, because the customer's true claim is against the resident that caused the drink to spill.
D. No, because the restaurant did not breach any duty owed to the customer.
