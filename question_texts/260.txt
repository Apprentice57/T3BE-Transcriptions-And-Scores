OA558: One Year Since 1/6 - What Merrick Garland Said (and Didn't Say)

A man got divorced from his wife. The judgment of divorce granted their marital home to the man's ex-wife. The man rented an apartment nearby. The man was upset that his ex-wife had kept their dog. The man believed that the dog belonged to him as he had paid for the dog and it was his before the man and the ex-wife were married. The ex-wife refused to give the dog to the man.

One night, the man was looking at pictures of his dog and got very upset that his ex-wife would not return the dog to him. The man drove to his ex-wife's house and knocked on the door. Nobody answered the door. The man could hear the dog barking. He decided to take the dog back to his house. To his surprise, the door was unlocked. He opened the door, and the dog greeted him. At that moment, he felt bad for his ex-wife and decided to leave without taking the dog. The man was later charged with burglary.

What is the best argument that the man did not commit burglary?

A - He did not have the requisite intent to commit burglary.
B - He was not armed with a dangerous weapon.
C - He did not break into the dwelling.
D - He abandoned the crime.
