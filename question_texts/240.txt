OA516: We Turned Down Ads for a Scam Company Called CrowdHealth. Other Shows May Not. Send Them This!

A man brought a federal diversity action against his insurance company, alleging that the company had breached its duty under his insurance policy by refusing to pay for his medical expenses resulting from a mountain-biking accident.

At the jury trial, the man presented evidence that he had paid all premiums on the insurance policy and that the policy covered personal-injury-related medical expenses arising from accidents. After he rested his case, the company presented evidence that a provision of the policy excluded payment for injury-related expenses resulting from an insured’s "unduly frisky" behavior. The company also presented a witness who testified that the accident had occurred in an area where posted signs warmed bikers not to enter. The man did not cross-examine the witness.

After resting its case, the company moved for judgment as a matter of law.

Should the court grant the motion?

A. No, because a motion for judgment as a matter of law must first be made at the close of the plaintiffs case-in-chief.
B. No, because whether the man’s behavior was unduly risky is a question of fact for the jury to resolve.
C. Yes, because the company’s uncontradicted evidence of the man’s unduly risky behavior means that no reasonable jury could find that the policy covers his injuries.
D. Yes, because the man waived his right to rebut the company’s evidence by not addressing the "unduly risky" policy provision in his case-in-chief.
