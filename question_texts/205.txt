OA446: Republicans Obliterate the Constitution in Texas v. Pennsylvania

A man was flipping through a manufacturer's catalogue one day and noticed that the manufacturer produces deck chairs. Interested in a set of four for his house, the man called the manufacturer and spoke with the salesperson. The parties orally agreed that the man would purchase four standard chairs for $600. The man said he might be able to come pick them up, and the salesperson replied that they would "make the necessary arrangements with a shipping company." Nothing else regarding delivery was mentioned.

The manufacturer immediately began work on the chairs. The next day, the man found different chairs that he liked better from another source. He sent an email to the manufacturer, stating the following: "I am no longer interested in purchasing the four chairs from you that we agreed upon yesterday. I am sorry for the inconvenience." He signed his name at the bottom of the email. While the manufacturer saw that he had an email from the man, the e-mail was not opened before the chairs were completed. The manufacturer arranged with a local shipping company to have the chairs shipped to the man’s billing address, delivered the chairs to the shipping company, and sent the man a new email stating that the chairs were on the way. The email from the man was then read, but it was too late as the chairs had already been shipped.

Unfortunately the chairs were damaged while in the shipping company’s possession. When they were delivered to the man, he refused to pay for them. The manufacturer brought a claim for breach of contract.

Who is likely to prevail?

A. The manufacturer, because the manufacturer relied on the man’s promise to buy the chairs.
B. The manufacturer, because the risk of loss had shifted to the man.
C. The man, because there is no enforceable contract.
D. The man, because the chairs were damaged in transit.
