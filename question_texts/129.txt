OA285: Tulsi Gabbard & Michael Flynn

A four-year-old child sustained serious injures when a playmate pushed him from between two parked cars into the street, where he was struck by a car. The child, by his representative, sued the driver of the car, the playmate's parents, and his own parents. At trial, the child's total damages were determined to be $100,000. The playmateâ€™s parents were determined to be 20% at fault because they had failed to adequately supervise her. The driver was found to be 50% at fault. The child's own parents were determined to be 30% at fault for failure to adequately supervise him. The court has adopted the pure comparative negligence doctrine, with joint and several liability, in place of the common law rules relating to plant's fault. In addition, the common law doctrines relating to intra-family liability have been abrogated.

What is the maximum amount, if anything, that the child's representative can recover from the driver?

A. $30,000.
B. $50,000.
C. $100,000.
D. Nothing.
