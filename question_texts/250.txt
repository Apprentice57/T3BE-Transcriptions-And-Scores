OA538: The Rittenhouse Trial Instructions, Explained

A woman hired a driver to drive her across town to her sister's house. The driver negligently failed to pay attention to where he was going and drove in the opposite direction of the sister's house. By the time the driver realized his error, it was too late to drive the woman back home. Thus, the driver paid for the woman to stay in a hotel room for the night. While the woman was dining at the hotel that evening, a man pickpocketed the woman's expensive pair of glasses out of her purse.

The woman sued the driver for the value of the glasses. Should she prevail?

A. Yes, since the driver negligently failed to pay attention to where he was going.
B. Yes, so long as the woman was not negligent in failing to notice the driver was going the wrong way.
C. No, since larceny is not a foreseeable result of the breach by the driver.
D. No, since the act of larceny was committed by a third person, not the driver.
