OA229: Andrew Miller & the Appointments Clause

A homeowner sued a plumber for damages resulting from the plumber’s allegedly faulty installation of water pipes in her basement, which caused flooding. At trial, the homeowner is prepared to testify that when she first detected the flooding, she turned off the water and called the plumber at his emergency number for help and that the plumber responded, "I'll come by tomorrow and redo the installation for free."

Is the homeowner's testimony regarding the plumber’s response admissible?

A. No, because the statement was an offer in compromise.
B. No, because it is hearsay not within any exception.
C. Yes, as a subsequent remedial measure.
D. Yes, as evidence of the plumber's fault.
