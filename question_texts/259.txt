OA556: Maxwell Convicted; BBC Invites Dershowitz to Comment Despite Massive Conflict of Interest

A man was driving home from work one cold December day and noticed a large, heavily decorated Christmas tree sitting outside of the city hall. The Christmas tree stood alone, was brightly lit with Christmas lights, and had several red and green ornaments decorating it. There were no other holiday or religious symbols on the city grounds. The man, who practices Judaism and who is a taxpayer in the city, was offended. He sued the city, arguing that the city exceeded its constitutional limits in erecting the Christmas tree

Assuming the man has standing, will the man prevail in his lawsuit?

A. Yes, because the city's display violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.
B. Yes, because the city's display violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.
C No, because the city may engage in free speech and spread whatever message it desires to so long as it does not prohibit citizens from engaging in the same free speech.
D. No, because the city's display does not violate the First Amendment.
