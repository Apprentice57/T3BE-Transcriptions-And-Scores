OA607: Will There Be Justice for Shaye Moss and Ruby Freeman? and Bye Bye Miranda Rights!

State A requires all state park rangers to pass a fitness test in order to be hired for a job as a state park ranger. The justification is that the job requires intense physical activity. Primarily men apply for the job. Last year, 50 men applied for the job as a state park ranger, and 10 women applied. 30 people passed the physical fitness test. All were men. The women brought a lawsuit claiming that the physical fitness test violated the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution

Will the women prevail in their lawsuit?

A. No, because the state can show that the fitness test is substantially related to an important government interest.
B. No, because there is a rational basis for the physical fitness test.
C. Yes, because the state cannot show that the fitness test is substantially related to an important government interest.
D. Yes, because the woman can demonstrate a discriminatory impact.
