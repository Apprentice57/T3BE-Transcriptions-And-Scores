An environmentalist decided to take up composting since the city she lived in had not yet adopted composting as part of its waste programs. The compost pile emitted very foul smells which could be smelled throughout the environmentalist's neighborhood by all of her neighbors. Before the environmentalist began composting, the neighbors used to hold pool parties, BBQs, and movie nights regularly outside. However, the horrible stench from the compost pile made it terribly unpleasant for the neighbors in the neighborhood to hold their events any longer. One of the neighbors who could no longer hold his weekly family movie nights due to the foul smell brought an action against the environmentalist for private nuisance.

Is the neighbor likely to succeed in his action?

A. No, because the neighbor has not suffered a harm different than that suffered by other neighbors.
B. No, because the environmentalist's compost pile is not interfering with a profitable use of the neighbor's land.
C. Yes, because the environmentalist's compost pile substantially and unreasonably interferes with the neighbor's use and enjoyment of his land.
D. Yes, because the neighbor's use of the property predates the environmentalist's interference.
