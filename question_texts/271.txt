OA584: Amazon Workers Unionize!

A state passed a statute that conditioned the holding of a classroom teacher position in all K-12 public schools in the state on being a citizen of the United States. A group of teachers that were denied employment on the basis of their citizenship challenged the constitutionality of this statute in state court

Assuming there are no issues in terms of standing, what is the most likely outcome of their challenge?

A. The statute will be deemed constitutional as it is rationally related to a legitimate government interest.
B. The statute will be deemed constitutional as it is substantially related to an important government interest.
C. The statute will be deemed unconstitutional as it is not narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling government interest.
D. The statute will be deemed unconstitutional as it infringes on a legislative area that is exclusively reserved for the United States Congress.
