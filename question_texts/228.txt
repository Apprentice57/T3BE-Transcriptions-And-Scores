OA492: Court Locks Mississippi Citizens Out of Amending Their Own Constitution

An attempt was made to hijack a commercial airliner while it was in flight from San Francisco to New Orleans. Within minutes, however, the hijacker was seized, and the plane proceeded to its destination. Upon the plane’s arrival, television stations broadcast pictures of the passengers as they disembarked. Among the passengers pictured on television was a businessman who was supposed to be in Chicago on company business. The disclosure that the businessman was in New Orleans and not in Chicago at the time resulted in the loss of his position with his company and great humiliation and embarrassment for him.

If the businessman asserts a claim against the television stations for broadcasting his picture as he disembarked, is he likely to prevail?

A. Yes, because the businessman’s location was revealed against his wishes.
B. Yes, because publication of the television pictures caused the businessman pecuniary loss.
C. No, because the humiliation and embarrassment did not result in physical harm to the businessman.
D. No, because the scene shown on television was newsworthy.
