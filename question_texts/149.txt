OA324: Trump's 9 Crimes and Misdemeanors

A man intensely disliked his neighbors. One night, intending to frighten them, he spray-painted their house with racial epithets and threats to kill them. The man was arrested and prosecuted under a state law providing that "any person who threatens violence against another person with the intent to cause that person to fear for his or her life or safety may be imprisoned for up to five years." In defense, the man claimed that he did not intend to kill his neighbors, but only to scare them so that they would move away.

Can the man constitutionally be convicted under this law?

A. No, because he was only communicating his views and had not commenced any overt action against the neighbors.
B. Yes, because he was engaged in trespass when he painted the words on his neighborsâ€™ house.
C. Yes, because his communication was a threat by which he intended to intimidate his neighbors.
D. Yes, because his communication was racially motivated and thus violated the protections of the Thirteenth Amendment.
