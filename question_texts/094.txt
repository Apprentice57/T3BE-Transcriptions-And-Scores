OA211: Manafort Flips (and more on Kavanaugh)

Congress passed a statute directing the United States Forest Service, a federal agency, to issue regulations to control campfires on federal public lands and to establish a schedule of penalties for those who violate the new regulations. The statute provides that the Forest Service regulations should "reduce, to the maximum extent feasible, all potential hazards that arise from campfires on Forest Service lands." The Forest Service issued the regulations and the schedule of penalties directed by Congress. The regulations include a rule that provides for the doubling of the fine for any negligent or prohibited use of fire if the user is under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

Which of the following arguments best supports a finding that the rule providing for the fines is constitutional?

A. The executive branch of government, of which the Forest Service is part, has inherent rule-making authority over public lands.
B. The rule was issued pursuant to a valid exercise of Congress's power to delegate rule-making authority to federal agencies.
C. The rule is justified by a compelling government interest in safeguarding forest resources,
D. The rule relates directly to law enforcement, which is an executive rather than a legislative function, and hence it does not need specific congressional authorization.
