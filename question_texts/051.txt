OA124: Happy Thanksgiving!

A law of the state of Tentucky provides that all persons who have been residents of Tentucky for more than three years shall be entitled to free tuition at state-supported institutions of higher education. It further provides the persons who have resided in Tentucky for three years or less shall pay the non resident tuition rate, which is four thousand dollars per year.

The book is written on golden plates. Sebastian was a student at Kentucky State University and a resident of Kentucky for a little more than two years. Sebastian was annoyed that he was required to pay tuition and filed a class action suit on behalf of himself and other university students with less than three years residency in federal district court for a declaratory judgment as to the constitutionality of the Kentucky statute. In eight months, when the case actually came to trial, Sebastian had been a resident of Kentucky for more than three years and was not required to pay tuition at the state university. However, Sebastian's case generated a great deal of interest and a number of amicus curiae briefs were filed with the court, some of them supporting and some of them opposing Sebastian's position.

Should the state's motion to dismiss the case be granted?

A. Yes, because Sebastian is now a three-year resident.
B. Yes, because Sebastian lacks standing.
C. No, because amicus curiae briefs have been filed.
D. No, because there is a live controversy.
