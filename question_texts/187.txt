OA404: Rule of Law Not Found

A man decided to give his farm to his nephew. The man took a deed to his attorney and told the attorney to deliver the deed to the nephew upon the manâ€™s death, The man also told the attorney to return the deed to him if he asked. None of these instructions to the attorney were in writing, and the deed was not recorded. The man then e-mailed the nephew informing him of the arrangement.

Shortly thereafter, the nephew died testate. In his will, he devised the farm to his daughter. Several years later, the man died intestate,
survived by two sons. The nephew's daughter immediately claimed ownership of the farm and demanded that the attorney deliver the deed to her.

Must the attorney deliver the deed to the daughter?

A. No, because a gratuitous death escrow is void unless supported by a written contract.
B. No, because the man never placed the deed beyond his control.
C. Yes, because the death of the nephew rendered the gratuitous death escrow irrevocable by the man.
D. Yes, because the deed to the nephew was legally delivered when the man took it to his attorney.
