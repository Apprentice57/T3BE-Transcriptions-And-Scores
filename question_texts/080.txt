OA182: Paul Manafort is Going to Prison

A car owner washed her car while it was parked on a public street, in violation of a local ordinance that prohibits the washing of vehicles on public streets during specified hours. The statute was enacted only to expedite the flow of automobile traffic. Due to sudden and unexpected cold weather, the car owner’s waste water formed a puddle that froze in a crosswalk. A Pedestrian slipped on the frozen puddle and broke her leg. The pedestrian sued the car owner to recover for her injury. At trial, the only evidence the pedestrian offered as to negligence was the car owner's admission that she had violated the ordinance. At the conclusion of the evidence, both parties moved for a directed verdict.

How should the trial judge proceed?

A. Deny both motions and submit the case to the jury, because, on the facts, the jury may infer that the car owner was negligent.
B. Deny both motions and submit the case to the jury, because the jury may consider the ordinance violation as evidence that the car owner was negligent.
C. Grant the car owner's motion, because the pedestrian has failed to offer adequate evidence that the car owner was negligent.
D. Grant the pedestrian’s motion, because of the car owner’s admitted ordinance violation.
