OA132: The Thomas Show! Can He Serve on the Federal Bench? Why is His High School Crazy? & More!

Ted asked Steve if he could borrow Steve's boat for a day cruise. Steve agreed, but instructed Ted to stay inside the bay. Ted cruised around the bay, then, because the ocean was so calm outside the bay, crossed a mile of open ocean to the Blue Oyster Bar on the docks at Santa Patagonia Island. While Ted was docked, another boat passed the dock at an illegally excessive speed and its wake washed onto Steve's boat, causing water damage to the upholstery of about $150. Ted returned the boat directly to Steve without further incident.

What, if any, recovery can Steve have against Ted resulting from Ted's use of Steve's boat?

A. Steve can recover nothing because Ted was not responsible for the water damage to the upholstery.
B. Steve can recover the cost of repairing the upholstery because it was damaged when Ted took the boat out of the bay.
C. Steve can recover the value of the boat because Ted was in dominion and control of the boat when it was damaged.
D. Steve can recover the value of the boat since Ted violated his instructions about staying in the bay.
