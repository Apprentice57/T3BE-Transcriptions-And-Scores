The HSS Massacre

Emmy, a licensed esthetician, owned a waxing center, Hair Free Carefree, in the city of Bayside, California. Emmy employed only women and catered only to female customers. Bayside had an ordinance that made it unlawful for any person to operate a female waxing center if the employees were female. Emmy the esthetician sued in federal court challenging the constitutionality of the Bayside  ordinance.

If the city of Bayside moves to dismiss the lawsuit on the basis that Emmy lacks standing, will the city win?

A. No, because the ordiance prevents the employees from exercising their free speech rights under the 1st Amendment.
B. No, because the employees and Emmy have rights that are harmed by the ordinance.
C. Yes, because only the employees can raise their 1st Amendment rights of association.
D. Yes, because the ordinance does not prohibit the operation of waxing centers per se, but only the right of the female employees to service female customers.
