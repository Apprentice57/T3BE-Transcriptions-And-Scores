OA Bar Prep With Heather! T3BE33

Tim was a devoted soccer fan. His favorite team was playing in the finals of the World Cup, and he had incredible tickets. As he was leaving for the stadium, his wife called him from their home. She was lying on the bed, disoriented, and she had run out of insulin again. As a diabetic, she was in danger of slipping into a coma unless she received an injection of insulin within the next few hours. Unwilling to miss the match, Tim committed himself to stop by a pharmacy on his way back from the game and get insulin for his wife. Unfortunately, the match went into extra time and a penalty kick shootout, and traffic was heavy leaving the parking lot, so Tim found his wife had died when he returned six hours later.

Which of the following crimes, if any, has Tim committed?

A. Murder.
B. Voluntary manslaughter.
B. Involuntary manslaughter.
D. No form of criminal homicide.
