Passing the Joint Tenancy

Wendy and Hubert bought a beautiful piece of land nestled among the hills with a lovely home situated on it, taking title as joint tenants. A few years later, they married and had a child, Kelly. Several years after that, Wendy and Hubert divorced. Wendy and Kelly continued to live on the land after the divorce, although titled remained in the names of both Hubert and Wendy. Hubert moved out of state, conveying all of his title and interest in the land by deed to Kelly. Shortly after, Hubert was killed one evening when a motorcycle fell on him while he was tidepooling by the ocean. Hubert died without a will.
