The Hysterical Victimhood Complex of John Eastman

Vinny, a local veterinarian, regularly rescued a variety of injured animals that he found in his neighborhood. He would keep the injured animals in his backyard sanctuary, where they were safe from harm and unable to escape while they recovered. Once they were fully healed, Vinny would release them back into the wild. One day, Vinny found an injured skunk rummaging around the trash bins while he was walking on a local hiking trail. He brought the skunk to his sanctuary where he nursed it back to health, then released it onto the hiking trail where he originally found it. The following week, the skunk bit a child who was playing in front of Vinny’s house, while the skunk was wandering around the neighborhood. The child’s parents sued Vinny. Is Vinny strictly liable for the skunk bite?

A. Yes, because Vinny released the skunk onto the hiking trail.
B. Yes, because Vinny nursed the skunk back to health.
C. No, because Vinny did not possess the skunk when it bit the child.
D. No, because Vinny never purchased the skunk as a pet.
