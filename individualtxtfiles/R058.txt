DoJ Memo Written In Crayon On Olive Garden Kids Menu Directs SDNY to Drop Eric Adams Case

Carly owns a fleet of trucks for her cake delivery business. She has been advertising a rebrand for several weeks in her store and on social media to generate excitement and more business. Carly hired Paul to repaint the fleet of trucks with the new logo. Paul agreed to paint the trucks for $5,000 and finish the work within 45 days. Paul and Carly signed a contract stating these terms. After signing the agreement, Carly reviewed her calendar and realized that she has been advertising the release of the redesign in 30 days, not 45. Carly immediately calls Paul and asks if he can complete the day within the 30 day timeframe and he agrees, but only if Carly pays an additional $2,500. Carly is hesitant, but agrees to pay $7,500 in total. Paul paints the entire fleet of trucks with the new logo in the 30 day timeframe. However, Carly only pays Paul the $5,000 and refuses to pay the additional $2,500. Paul files suit against Carly to recover the additional $2,500.

Who will prevail in this lawsuit?

A. Paul, because Carly had a pre-existing duty to perform.
B. Paul, because he made a new promise to Carly in exchange for more money.
C. Carly, because Paul had a pre-existing duty to paint the trucks.
D. Carly, because Paul exerted undue influence over her regarding the additional $2,500.
