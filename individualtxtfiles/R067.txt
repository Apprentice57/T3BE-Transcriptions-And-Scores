T3BE67: To Larse or to Burgle?

Marsha decided she needed more spice in her life and purchased a brand new, fast, red motorcycle. She parked it in the garage attached to her house for safekeeping. Unfortunately, her flashy new two-wheeler caught the attention of one of her neighbors, Dillon.

Dillon loved motorcycles, but fell on hard times and did not have enough money to purchase one for himself. He was an engineer and adept at creating gadgets from things around his workshop. After seeing Marsha's new motorcycle, he created an automatic garage door opener that could open any automatic garage door. One night, he used the device to open Marsha's garage door, hotwire the motorcycle, and take it for a joyride. Dillon intended only to drive around town, show off to his friends, and enjoy the wind in his hair for a few hours before returning the motorcycle to Marsha's garage without her knowing.

However, while Dillon was out cruising around, he detoured to his friend's party at the beach. After parking Marsha's motorcycle atop the cliffs overlooking the ocean, he felt a rush of anger at the unfairness of the world, pushed the motorcycle off the cliff, and watched it fall and crash into the water below.

Under the common law, what crime or crimes is Dillon guilty of?

A. No crime.
B. Burglary.
C. Larceny.
D. Both Burglary and Larceny.
