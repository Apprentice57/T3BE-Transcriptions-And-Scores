The famous podcast host and comedian, Thomas, was asked by talks how host Jimmy Fallon what type of soda he drank during an interview on The Tonight Show. Thomas responded with "I only drink Columbia Cola because it's the best refreshing soft drink."

A week later, Columbia Cola began an international ad campaign on social media. It featured a picture of Thomas holding a can of Columbia Cola in one hand and his quote form the show. Columbia Cola did not receive Thomas' permission to use his statement from the interview or his picture.

Will Thomas prevail in a lawsuit against Columbia Cola for using his statement and picture?

A. Yes, because Thomas has been defamed.
B. Yes, because Thomas' likeness was appropriated for a commercial purpose without his consent.
C. No, because the ad accurately reflects what Thomas said publicly before a large audience.
D. No, because Thomas' appearance on TV created an implied consent to reasonable use of anything he might say.
