OA Bar Prep With Heather! T3BE32

A Senate committee conducted an investigation into alleged corruption in the Department of Transportation (DOT). After a thorough investigation, the committee, on the advice of the Senate committee, passed a statute that removed the agents from the DOT and barred them from any other federal employment. The three agents, whose employment permitted removal with or without cause, were named in the statute. The agents subsequently challenged the statute on the basis that it was unconstitutional.

Will the agents' challenge to the statute be successful?

A. No, because the agents could be removed with or without cause.
B. No, because the statute does not subject the agents to criminal or penal measures.
C. Yes, because the statute constitutes an ex post facto law.
D. Yes, because the statute constitutes a bill of attainder.
