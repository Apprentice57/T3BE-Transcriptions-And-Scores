‘Run for Something’ Is Stronger Than Ever. We’re Going to Need It.

Wendy owned a 50-acre farm. For many years, she grew corn on a 20-acre parcel located in the southwestern portion of the property. In May, Wendy planted her annual crop of corn, which she usually harvested in September. In August, Wendy sold her farm to a corn grower, Gerry, for $500,000. At the time Wendy sold her farm, the crop of corn was mature and growing well. When Wendy and Gerry entered into the sale of the farm, there was no mention of the corn crop.

In late September, after Gerry took possession of the farm, Wendy contacted him and asked permission to harvest the crop of corn. Gerry refused to allow Wendy to re-enter the property and pic the corn.

Wendy brings suit against Gerry seeking to re-enter the farm and remove the crop of corn that she planted.

Which of the following is correct regarding the respective rights of the parties?

A. Wendy is not entitled to remove the corn crop, and thus is not entitled to re-enter the farm.
B. Wendy and Gerry each have title to the corn crop, and consequently there should be an equitable division of the proceeds from the sale of the crop between both parties
C. Wendy is entitled to remove the corn crop, but she must pay Gerry a fee to enter the farm, thus gaining acess to the corn
D. Wendy is entitle to remove the corn crop and is not required to pay Gerry for entering the farm, thus gaining access to the crop.
