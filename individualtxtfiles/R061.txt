As Trump Drones On, Democrats Resistance Takes Different Forms

Oscar owns an axe throwing pub, Hops and Hatchets. His friend Dawn warned him that leaving the axes laying around without proper safety protocols for putting them away, was a recipe for disaster. One day, Dawn dropped by Hops and Hatchets to check in on Oscar and noticed several axes strewn about. She decided to teach Oscar a lesson since he refused to take her warning seriously. Dawn took an axe that had been left out and swung it around like she was going to strike Oscar, who was standing at the bar with his back turned. Dawn said, "if you move an inch, you're toast!" Oscar heard the swing of the axe, and was terrified of being almost hit with it, but suffered no physical or other harm.

If Oscar sues Dawn, what is the most likely result?

A. Oscar will not recover because he suffered no physical harm.
B. Oscar will not recover because Dawn was joking.
C. Oscar will recover because Dawn was negligent.
D. Oscar will recover because he was afraid Dawn would hit him with the axe.
