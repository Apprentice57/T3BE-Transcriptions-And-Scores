Thereâ€™s Something Deeply Wrong With Stephen Miller (And There Always Has Been)

The state of Hawaii enacted a law that prohibited the sale of violent video games to anyone under the age of eighteen and imposed a fine for each violation. The legislative history showed a concern that there was a correlation between playing violent video games and subsequent violent behavior in minors. Blood Rage, a maker of video games, brought suit arguing that the law violated its First Amendment right of free speech.

Is Hawaii's law unconstitutional?

A. Yes, because the state law is a content-based restriction.
B. Yes, because the costs of such a restriction on speech outweigh its benefits.
C. No, because states have the power to protect children from harm.
D. No, because video games do not qualify for First Amendment protection.
