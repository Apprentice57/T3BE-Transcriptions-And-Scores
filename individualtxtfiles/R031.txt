OA Bar Prep With Heather! T3BE31

A landowner owned 200 acres of land in a rural district 50 miles outside of a major metropolitan area and airport. Due to a field of vision problem pilots experienced in the vicinity of the landowner's property, the county determined it was necessary to erect a 100-foot tall aviation light signal on the landowner's property. Pursuant to its authority under a state law regarding air travel, the county installed the aviation light on a corner of the landowner's property that he did not use. The landowner requested compensation for the installation but the county refused to pay him. The landowner subsequently sued the county.

Is the landowner constitutionally entitled to just compensation?

A. No, because the light signal was installed on an unused portion of the landowner's property.
B. No, because the county's action is rationally related to a legitimate government interest.
C. Yes, because the county installed a permanent structure on the landowner's property.
D. Yes, because the county's action adversely affected the landowner's property interest.
